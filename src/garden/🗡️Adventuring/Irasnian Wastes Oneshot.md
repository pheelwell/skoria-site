## The Desert Crawler Heist: A D&D Adventure Module

### Background

The adventurers awaken within the confines of a grand, oriental-style crawler a colossal construct on four towering legs that plods through the desolate Irasnian Desert. This moving fortress is a hub of activity and intrigue, playing host to 50 souls. Among them are Rindal, a zealous priestess of Zarinesh, deity of change and synthetics; and Karach, a gnomish rogue with ties to an infamous group known as The Goats.

### Appendices

#### NPC Profiles

##### Karach

A gnomish rogue with ties to The Goats organization. He is determined to steal Rindal's artifact and deliver it to his employers—the Quorri. His demeanor may shift from charmingly happy to callously pragmatic when his plans are threatened.

##### Werewolf Twins: Oriat & Esron

Oriat operates alongside Karach while Esron takes control of navigation in an effort to redirect the crawler toward Crystal Forest. These twins are instrumental in orchestrating chaos aboard.

#### Adventure Hooks

1. A hidden compartment within their quarters that holds clues about how they arrived at their current predicament.
2. A mysterious drink order from last night that none recall ordering but appears on their tab—a mix-up that suggests tampering by another party.

#### Puzzle Design: Control Room Lock

To access the control room again after Esron locks it down:

1. Players enter the machine room where they find an intricate locking mechanism involving wires and modifiers:
   - **Action Wires**: Alteration (Deactivate/Activate/Reduce/Enlarge)
   - **Target Wires**: Doors/Logs/Security/Legs
   
2. The correct combination is hinted at through lore books found throughout previous rooms—perhaps leveraging Liaphine's knowledge—and visually marked wear patterns around certain wires suggesting common usage patterns.

3. The solution involves connecting:
   - "Activate" + "Doors" = Open access doors
   - "Deactivate" + "Security" = Lower security protocols
   
4. Successful resolution grants them entry to confront Esron in time for defense planning against Quorri forces.

#### Magic Items Distribution

Consider distributing humorous yet useful magic items amongst players as rewards for overcoming challenges or exploring thoroughly:

- Malia finds a Flute of Serenity capable of calming aggressive creatures for a short period once per day.
- Brummelchen locates Dwarven Greataxe that deals additional radiant damage against shapechangers like werewolves.
- Liaphine unearths an ancient tome about shape-shifting magics which she can study for unique spell insights.
- Teru discovers Scrolls of Martial Harmony containing tortle combat movements effective against lycanthropes.

### Final Notes

Remember that this module outline is flexible; adjust encounters based on how your players interact with NPCs like Karach or react to surprises like werewolf attacks or drone swarms. Balance puzzles so all members feel involved based on their backgrounds while maintaining narrative cohesion throughout this thrilling desert crawler escapade!

### Key Locations

#### Tavern Room (Bar)

A cozy room filled with chatter and laughter serves as both a meeting point for wary allies and potential betrayers.

#### Outside Walkway

Encircling the tavern is an open-air promenade where desert winds tell tales of what lies beyond.

#### Crew Quarters

Private rooms reveal secrets and serve as havens—or traps—for those who seek refuge or conspire within them.

#### Command Deck (Top Floor)

The very brain of the crawler hides both power and vulnerability—the control room where destinies can be altered at a flick of a switch.

#### Machine Room (Bottom Floor)

A pulsating heart full of grinding gears where one wrong step could spell disaster—or opportunity—for technician-savvy intruders.

### NPCs

#### Rindal - Priestess of Zarinesh

A devout worshipper safeguarding an artifact capable of matter reconfiguration. Her faith may either illuminate or blind her to danger.

#### Karach - Gnomish Rogue (Affiliated with The Goats)

An opportunist cloaked in charm but driven by greed. His mission intertwines fatefully with that of Rindal's sacred charge.

#### Indal - Lionkin Waiter

An affable soul who might spill more than drinks should his tongue be loosened by trust...or coin.

#### Enra - Barmaid

Keeper of tales—and possibly keys—to unraveling enigmas that cling to every corner like cobwebs in this traveling fortress.

### Encounters

#### Drone Assault

A skirmish outside against metallic pests foreshadows greater threats looming on sandy horizons.

Now flesh out the first Scene with Detailed Descriptions, Dialogues, skill checks and Room Descriptions. Start with the description of the Bar in the Zarinesh oriental style. Don't mention the desert or the crawler  that and have that as a revelation in the next szene. 

## The Desert Crawler Heist: A D&D Adventure Module

### Act I: Awakenings

#### Scene 1: Mysterious Beginnings

##### Setting the Stage

The flickering light of oil lamps casts a warm glow over the tavern room's intricate mosaics and sumptuous, cushioned divans. Tapestries depicting mythical creatures and abstract desert landscapes drape the walls, while the scent of exotic spices wafts from a corner where a brass samovar stands ready to serve hot tea. The air is filled with the soft melodies of a stringed oud playing in the background.

The players find themselves seated at a low table strewn with colorful pillows, each nursing the remnants of what appears to have been an indulgent revelry. Their heads throb in unison with the faint but persistent rhythm pulsating through the floorboards.

##### Encounter Details
- **Objective**: Players must piece together how they arrived at this location and deal with Karach's surprising proposal.
- **Key NPCs**: Karach, Rindal (mentioned), Barmaid Enra (later)
- **Notable Features**:
  - An assortment of beverages and half-eaten delicacies lay scattered across their table.
  - Patrons converse in hushed tones—their faces an amalgam of weary travelers and mysterious locals.

##### Starting Dialogue

As they attempt to gather their senses, Karach approaches—a wiry gnome with sharp features framed by low-hanging lanterns. His eyes glint mischievously as he speaks:

"Ah, my erstwhile associates! How does this fine morn find you? A bit... clouded, perchance? No matter. We have before us a scheme ripe with fortune—one we discussed under last night's silvered moon."

##### Skill Checks
- **Wisdom (Insight) Check**: Determine if Karach is hiding something or being truthful about their prior agreement.
- **Constitution Saving Throw**: Resist lingering effects of what might have been drugged libations from the previous night.
- **Intelligence (History) Check**: Recall any pertinent information about Zarinesh or Rindal that may help assess Karach's claim.

##### Room Description

The tavern room is circular in shape, adorned with zellige tiles that climb halfway up its walls before meeting plaster painted in deep reds and blues. A central hearth remains unlit against the day's warmth. Several alcoves provide semi-private nooks for conversation or solitary contemplation.

Each player spots personal items strewn carelessly amid empty cups hinting at activities prior to their memory gap.

##### Player Interaction

Players can question Karach directly or subtly probe for information among themselves and other patrons.

###### Dialogue Options for Karach:
- If questioned about specifics: "Details, details! All you need know is encompassed within this—our prize awaits beneath silken folds; a relic imbued with divine essence. Surely you recall our accord?"
  
- If pressed about possible drugging: "A misstep! An errant drop meant solely for divine lips found its way into your cups—a mere accident!"

###### Initial Reactions:

Depending on players' choices:

- If siding with Karach: They feel a twinge of unease but also curiosity about what fortunes might be gained from this caper.
  
- If skeptical: They sense duplicity in his demeanor and begin to piece together that they may have been unwilling pawns in his scheme thus far.

-

This is a nice form, keep this Structure for then next scenes

- add a Skillcheck for the small drone entering and let the barmaid call the party to interviene or something bad will happen.
Then add a scene transition to going outside, also if they are going for the door, add a "shake" from "Esron" and an excuse from every transition hereout. 
-

##### The Drone Disturbance

As the players weigh their newfound situation, a sudden whirring sound distracts them. A small drone, no larger than a breadbasket, zips erratically around the room. It's adorned with glowing runes and emits faint, pulsating vibrations that resonate with an otherworldly energy.

###### Skill Checks
- **Dexterity Saving Throw**: Avoid being struck by the erratic drone.
- **Arcana Check**: Identify the nature of the drone's enchantments or its potential purpose aboard the crawler.

Just as patrons begin to show signs of alarm, Barmaid Enra steps briskly over to your table, her expression stern, "That blasted thing is back! Kill this thing, once it leaves this room we are doomed!"

###### As Players Decide:
- If they choose to engage with the drone: 
	- They can attack (AC 10) or try to trap it (Sleight of Hand AC 10) 

 If they are going for the door: Suddenly, the entire tavern lurches as if shaken by an unseen giant. From above, a voice echoes down—a smooth contralto attempting reassurance amidst confused murmurs:

  “Apologies for the disturbance... Just a minor adjustment to our course. Please return to your revelries.”

Following Esron's feigned announcement from above (unbeknownst to players), tension gives way to necessity. Players must act quickly before more chaos ensues within the moving tavern.

-
now describe the scene 2 First Clash.
Start with setting the scene and give a nice flavor text.
Just reveal the desert is moving from left to right, don't outright tell them they are on a crawler
Next scene, describe drones beeing 3 small dots first then getting bigger and bigger and bigger (until dog sized) stop writing before encounter starts 
-

### Act I: Awakenings

#### Scene 2: First Clash

##### Setting the Scene

Gathering their wits and making for the exit, the adventurers push through heavy, ornate curtains that serve as the doorway and step out onto an expansive walkway. The immediate contrast from the tavern's warmth to the biting chill of desert air is jarring. Sand whispers along the stone beneath their feet, and a vast horizon stretches endlessly before them.

The sun hangs low in a cloudless sky, casting long shadows that dance rhythmically with each passing moment. They find themselves gazing out onto an ocean of dunes—a landscape alive yet still—undulating with the silent cadence of time itself.

Curiosity quickly turns to concern as they realize that this desert vista is moving steadily from left to right, like an ever-scrolling canvas behind which hides untold secrets.

##### Approach of Danger

At first sighted as mere specks in the distance, three dark shapes grow increasingly discernible against the pale sands. As they draw nearer, their form becomes clear—all insect-like carapace and twitching antennae—the size of large hounds.

###### Skill Checks
- **Wisdom (Perception) Check**: Determine how far away the drones are and how much time there is to prepare.
- **Intelligence (Nature) Check**: Recall any knowledge about these creatures—perhaps from tales or books read long ago.

With each second, tension builds among those gathered on the walkway. The wind carries a soft hum growing ever louder and more ominous—a chorus sung by approaching metal wings.

##### Transition to Combat

The creatures are now close enough for details to be seen; gleaming segments interlock across their bodies, small runes pulsate on their exoskeletons. Each drone navigates with eerie precision as they home in on their quarry—the players standing in confused readiness upon this ever-moving bastion in the sands.

###### As Players Prepare:
- If they ready weapons or spells: They feel a surge of adrenaline knowing that a trial by combat is imminent.
- If they seek shelter or make strategic moves: They realize that understanding this environment will be key to survival—not just now but for whatever lies ahead on this journey through shifting sands.

Just before steel meets chitin or spells illuminate the desert air, another gentle shudder passes underfoot, reminding all aboard that no battleground remains static when perched atop a colossus made for traversing these ancient dunes.

-
now add the encounter details to properly run the combat
Keep in mind: last drone will try to flee on 4 hp or less
-

#### Scene 2: First Clash

##### Encounter Details
- **Objective**: Survive the initial drone attack and protect the crawler.
- **Enemies**: Three giant drones (dog-sized)
- **Setting**: Outside walkway with desert scenery moving in the background.

##### Combat Setup

As the adventurers take in the sight of the approaching drones, they must quickly decide on their plan of action. The walkway offers little in terms of cover, but its width allows for some maneuverability. With each passing moment, the drones grow larger, revealing glistening mandibles and wings buzzing like saws through air.

###### Pre-Combat Checks
- **Initiative Roll**: To determine combat order.
- **Intelligence (Arcana) Check**: To identify any weaknesses or magical properties of the drones.

##### Combat Mechanics

The three giant drones approach with menacing intent. Their bodies are covered in chitin that gleams under the sun, and they move with a purpose driven by some unseen controller's will.

They will try to seek the adventure with:

- The most Magical Items
- Magical Users

***Rending Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* (1d8 +2) piercing damage.

##### During Combat:

As combat ensues, each successful strike against a drone might cause it to release a burst of arcane energy—sparks that dissipate into the dry desert air. The players must be wary; these drones are not only physically formidable but potentially carry other threats within their metallic carapaces.

When a drone falls below half health, it begins to emit a high-pitched whine—an apparent signal for retreat or perhaps a distress call that could bring more peril upon them all.

##### Escape Attempt:

Upon reaching or dropping below four hit points, a drone attempts to flee back towards whatever mysterious origin they came from—if not stopped, it may alert others of its kind or worse yet, return with reinforcements far beyond what any would wish to encounter amidst these already treacherous sands.

As blows are exchanged and spells cast, another tremor passes through the crawler's massive body—a reminder that even as they battle for survival upon its back, it carries them forward inexorably through an unforgiving land where danger lurks just beneath every grain of sand.

#### Act II: It Unfolds

##### Scene 3: Listening in on Karach

###### Setting the Scene

With the drone threat momentarily abated, the adventurers' attention turns inward once more. The tavern's lively atmosphere has shifted, now tinged with an undercurrent of tension as whispers of the recent skirmish weave through the crowd. As they re-enter through the heavy curtains, they notice Karach engaged in hushed conversation with a shadowy figure at a secluded table.

###### Encounter Details
- **Objective**: Eavesdrop on Karach to learn more about his true intentions.
- **Key NPCs**: Karach, Oriat (Karach's associate)
- **Notable Features**:
  - The tavern room seems smaller now, crowded with curious onlookers and wary patrons.
  - An air of suspicion hangs as thick as pipe smoke under the low-hung lanterns.

###### Skill Checks
- **Stealth Check**: To approach Karach's table without drawing attention.
- **Perception Check**: To clearly hear the conversation between Karach and his comrade.
  
##### Overheard Dialogue

As players inch closer to eavesdrop, they catch bits of a tense exchange:

Oriat's voice is gravelly and low: "The artifact... You're certain it will lead us to Crystal Forest?"

Karach replies with barely concealed impatience: "Yes, yes! Once in hand, we steer this beast towards destiny. And our Quorri benefactors... they'll uphold their end?"

Oriat grunts affirmatively but adds a note of caution: "They better. We're not playing games here—this is about power."

###### Player Interaction

Depending on how players choose to handle this situation:

- If confronting Karach: They must be ready for potential conflict or smooth-talking their way out of immediate danger.
  
- If gathering further evidence: They might need to perform additional checks or find creative ways to uncover more information without being detected.

##### Transition

As they contemplate their next move, another shudder courses through the floor—a creaking groan that sends ripples through drinks and casts furtive glances upward. Once again Esron’s voice spills into the room from unseen speakers:

“Do not be alarmed by these brief disturbances. We adjust for wind and sand... for your continued comfort.”

The adventurers must decide quickly whether to act on what they've learned about Karach—or risk losing precious time as machinations continue out of sight.

##### Scene 4: Infos in Common Room

###### Setting the Scene

Seeking clarity amidst chaos, players mingle among other passengers within the common room—a space less ostentatious than the tavern yet still vibrant with activity. Here travelers sit engrossed in games or deep discussion while others simply enjoy reprieve from desert winds outside.

###### Encounter Details:
- **Objective**: Gain additional insights from other passengers; verify conflicting information.
- **Key NPCs**: Indal (Lionkin waiter), various passengers
- **Notable Features**:
  - Several groups are clustered around tables laden with maps and various artifacts—traders perhaps, or explorers sharing tales of fortune and folly alike.
###### Skill Checks
- **Charisma (Persuasion) Check**: To encourage Indal or passengers to share recollections from last night's festivities.
  
##### Gathered Information

Indal offers tidbits between serving meals:

"Well now," he begins with a hint of pride. "It was quite an evening! Every soul aboard was merry—the priestess too... though she kept to herself mostly."

He pauses before continuing conspiratorially: "But here's a peculiarity; not one amongst us recalls inviting those Goats aboard... Strange times indeed."

Others provide similar accounts that vary slightly—details that don't quite align or names remembered differently by each storyteller.

###### Player Interaction

Players can choose how deeply they wish to delve into these discrepancies:

- Investigating further: They might engage in detailed conversations or offer assistance for any onboard troubles revealed during discussions.
  
- Reporting back to Rindal or confronting Karach again: With newfound evidence in hand, players must tread carefully lest they endanger themselves further amidst this den of secrets and lies.

Each piece of gathered lore feels like another key turning within an intricate lock—one that could either open doors to salvation or unleash perils untold upon all who sail this desert sea.

-
Now handle the encounter the players will face when karach distrusts and tries to kill.

-

#### Act II: It Unfolds

##### Scene 3: Confrontation with Karach

###### Setting the Stage

In the dim light of Karach's quarters, the gnome's features take on a sinister edge. He ushers the party inside, where a tiefling—muscle taut and eyes wary—stands by the door. As it shuts with a definitive click, tension coils in the air like a spring.

###### Encounter Details:
- **Objective**: Survive Karach's treacherous assault.
- **Enemies**: Two werewolves (Karach and his tiefling companion)
- **Setting**: Karach's cramped quarters filled with maps and strange devices.

###### Pre-Combat Checks
- **Initiative Roll**: To determine combat order.
- **Insight Check**: Sense Karach’s impending betrayal before he strikes.

##### Combat Mechanics

As players prepare for confrontation, both Karach and his tiefling ally begin to shift form—their bodies elongating, fur sprouting violently as they transform into snarling werewolves.

###### Werewolf Stats (Toned Down)
- **Armor Class** 11 (Natural Armor)
- **Hit Points** 18 (4d8 +4)
- **Speed** 30 ft. (40 ft. in wolf form)

***Claws (Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* (2d4 +2) slashing damage.

During combat:

The tight quarters force close-quarters combat—a savage dance of tooth and claw versus steel and spellcraft. Though the werewolves are fearsome foes, their reduced strength gives our novice adventurers a fighting chance against these lycanthropic assassins.

##### Escape Attempt:

If either werewolf drops to half health, they attempt to flee or regroup—perhaps by smashing through a window or retreating to a more defensible position within the room.

As the clash ensues, another gentle tremor from Esron’s meddling passes through the floor—a reminder that this battle is but one of many challenges aboard this colossal desert crawler.

#### Conclusion of Combat:

Victory brings not only relief but also questions—who sent these creatures? What machinations continue while blood is spilled in quiet corners of this ever-moving behemoth?

The adventurers must swiftly decide their next course—attend to wounds and interrogate any survivors or return to Rindal with news of this betrayal?

#### Act IIIa: Defending Rindal

##### Scene 5a: Telling Rindal about Karach

###### Setting the Stage

With the werewolf threat neutralized, the adventurers seek out Rindal amidst the crawler's many rooms. They find her in silent prayer within a small shrine dedicated to Zarinesh, her silver ornaments reflecting faint light from sputtering candles.

###### Encounter Details:
- **Objective**: Inform Rindal of Karach's betrayal and seek guidance or reward.
- **Key NPCs**: Rindal (Priestess of Zarinesh)
  
##### Dialogue Interaction

The priestess greets them with a mixture of surprise and curiosity:

Rindal looks up, her serene gaze belying a mind whirring with thoughts: "You return with heavy news, I see. Speak plainly—what shadow has fallen upon us now?"

As they recount the tale of Karach's treachery and the battle that ensued, Rindal's eyes narrow slightly—a flicker of something indiscernible passing through their depths.

###### Skill Checks
- **Charisma (Persuasion) Check**: Convince Rindal to offer them a reward for their loyalty and bravery.

Upon hearing their request for compensation, she responds:

"A fair ask. While material gains pale in comparison to spiritual wealth, I understand your worldly needs. Follow me below; there is something that may aid you further."

Rindal leads them to the machine room—a place where faith intertwines with mechanics in service to Zarinesh.

##### The Machine Room

###### Setting the Scene

Descending into the belly of the crawler, they are met with an overwhelming cacophony—the symphony of gears grinding and pistons pumping in rhythmic harmony. Here lies the heart of this colossal machine—a sanctum where only few dare tread.

###### Enchantment Ritual
- **Objective**: Receive a minor enchantment on one item.

Rindal approaches a workbench cluttered with tools and strange components. She gestures toward their weapons or equipment:

"Choose an item—something personal, something vital to your journey," she instructs as she begins chanting softly in a language that seems older than time itself.

The chosen item begins to glow under her ministrations as she imbues it with potent energies—granting it new properties that may prove essential in trials yet unseen.

##### Post-Enchantment

With their newly enhanced gear in hand, uncertainty grips them once more—as does another tremor from above followed by Esron’s voice:

“Rest assured our path remains true; these tremors are but whispers from beneath golden sands. My door is currently jammed, but we will take a short rest in the near cavern so i can fix this, a Zarinesh Engineering team is already on its way”
