- Maschinenraum: Hier befinden sich die riesigen Maschinen, die den Crawler antreiben. Es ist ein lauter und staubiger Raum voller Rohre, Ventile und Schalttafeln. Nur Fachleute sollten diesen Raum betreten, da er gefährlich sein kann.

- Lager: Hier werden alle Vorräte gelagert, die für die Reise benötigt werden. Es gibt Regale mit Lebensmitteln, Wasserbehältern, Medikamenten und anderen wichtigen Gegenständen. Der Raum ist gut organisiert und alles ist beschriftet.

Random Table für Intro:

## Notes From First Session

Players:

Malia: Elf

### Brummelchen

Dwarf Warrior

**Personality Traits**: I face problems head-on. A simple, direct solution is the best path to success. I’ve lost too many friends, and I’m slow to make new ones.

**Ideals**: Live and Let Live. Ideals aren’t worth killing over or going to war for. (Neutral)

**Bonds**: Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.

**Flaws**: I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.

### Liaphine Gavonn ()

Wood Elf Sourcerer 

**Personality Traits**: I’ve read every book in the world’s greatest libraries—or I like to boast that I have.

**Ideals**: Logic. Emotions must not cloud our logical thinking. (Lawful) No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic) Self-Improvement. The goal of a life of study is the betterment of oneself. (Any)

**Bonds**: I’ve been searching my whole life for the answer to a certain question.

**Flaws**: I am easily distracted by the promise of information. I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others.

### Malia Obama (Philip)

Eldarin Elf Bard

**Personality Traits**: I’m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home. I was, in fact, raised by wolves.

**Ideals**: Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)

**Bonds**: An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.

**Flaws**: There’s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.

### Teru Mishi

Tortle Monk

**Personality Traits**: I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.

**Ideals**: Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)

**Bonds**: I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.

**Flaws**: My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.

## NPCs

Karach:

Leader of [[The Goats.md|Goats]] Assasination Troop

## Journal
- Players woke up in Tavern Room of Crawler not knowing how they got there
	- Karach told them they plan to Steal Artifact
	- (DM Info,Players don't Know: short term Amnesia, Karach wanted to drug Priestes but didn't succeed)
	- Players didn't believe Karach, saying they won't agree to this kind of work
- Players got rid of small Locust didn't attract Swarm (done)
	- fought of 4 big Locusts outside no one escaped, no swarm incoming
- Priestes left Tavern room and did go downstairs

This is what happened so far, we played 2,5h.

I want to have another session that goes 2x 2,5h.

Structure the next Session with concrete material i can use that helps the priestes x Karach [[pl|[pl]]ot]([Plot) line.

I want:

- Someone thanking them for killing the Bugs
	- Info other Passengers are passed out and have short term amnesia
- Players to have multiple ways to expose Karachs plans
- Some interesting random encounters that could change the Narative
- A table of funny magic items they can find

## Session 2 Outline

### Introduction
- Recap of previous session
	- Players wake up to find themselves in the tavern room of the Crawler, with no memory of how they got there. They see Rindal, the priestess, leaving the room.

### [[Scene]] 1: Thankful Passengers
- Indal (Lionkin) thanks
	- Malia -> Today Crystal Forest drop
		- Liaphine -> Int

### [[Scene]] 2: Exposing Karach's Plans
#### Option 1: Confront Karach
- The players can choose to confront Karach directly about his plans to steal the artifact. This could lead to a tense conversation or even a fight if Karach feels threatened.
- Karach may try to convince the players that stealing the artifact is for a greater cause or that it will benefit everyone on the Crawler.

#### Option 2: Gather Evidence
- The players can search for evidence or talk to other passengers in order to gather proof of Karach's intentions. They can find clues in various rooms or overhear conversations that hint at Karach's true motives.
	 - Players can search Karach's belongings for any documents or notes that may reveal his plans.
	- They can eavesdrop on conversations between Karach and other passengers.
		- Karach has two Partners that he is defaulting to.
	- Players can talk to other passengers who may have overheard or witnessed suspicious behavior from Karach.
	- They can confront Rindal, the priestess, and ask her about her relationship with Karach and if she knows anything about his plans.

### [[Scene]] 3: Random Encounters
- As the players move through different areas of the Crawler, they may encounter various random events that could change the narrative or provide additional challenges.
	1. **Mechanical Malfunction**: A sudden malfunction in one of the crawler's legs causes it to stumble and shake violently. The players must find a way to stabilize it before it collapses.
	2. **Sandstorm**: A sandstorm approaches, obscuring vision and making it difficult to navigate. The players must find shelter or risk getting lost in the desert.
	3. **Mysterious Stranger**: The players encounter a mysterious stranger who seems to know more about the artifact and Karach's plans than they should. They can choose to trust or confront this stranger.

### [[Scene]] 4: Confrontation with Karach
- Regardless of how the players gather evidence, they will eventually have a confrontation with Karach to expose his plans.
- Depending on their actions and the evidence they have, this confrontation could be peaceful or turn into a fight.
- The outcome of this confrontation will determine the next steps for the players and potentially impact the fate of the artifact.

### Conclusion
- Wrap up the session by discussing the consequences of the players' actions and setting up for future sessions.
- If Karach is exposed, it could lead to a new conflict or alliance with other factions on the Crawler.
- If Karach succeeds in stealing the artifact, it could lead to a chase or rescue mission in [[Ergon]].

## Magic Items Table

You can use this table to generate funny and interesting magic items that the players can find during their journey on the Crawler.

1. **Ring of Unending Nourishment**: This ring magically fills your stomach, making you feel full no matter how much you eat. However, it does not provide any actual nutrition.
3. **Cape of Billowing**: This cape billows dramatically whenever the user wants to make a grand entrance or add flair to their actions.
4. **Bag of Endless Pockets**: This bag seems small on the outside, but has an infinite amount of storage space inside. However, it is also a bit disorganized, making it difficult to find specific items. To grab items from the bag, pass a DC10 Investigation Check, on a fail, the item can not be restored by the character until the next long Rest. Other Characers can still try to find the item.
5. **Amulet of Misdirection**: Once per short Rest This amulet allows you to redirect a attack against you to another target within 30 feet. 
6. **Boots of Featherfalling (But Only When Falling Upwards)**: These boots slow your descent when falling, allowing you to land safely from great heights as long as you are falling upwards.
7. **Wand of Whimsical Effects**: This wand produces random magical effects when used, ranging from harmless sparks and colorful lights to more unpredictable results like turning the user into a frog for one minute.

The Travel is 1 Day (it is afternoon, arive at next afternoon) i need the player to be occupied:

 1. As the players explore the Crawler, they come across a hidden compartment in one of the rooms. Inside, they find a map that leads to a hidden treasure buried in the desert. They can choose to follow the map and search for the treasure, which could lead to encounters with dangerous creatures or rival treasure hunters.

2. While exploring the Crawler, the players stumble upon a locked room that seems to have been sealed off from the rest of the passengers. They can attempt to pick the lock or find another way to enter and discover what secrets lie within.

3. One of the passengers approaches the players and asks for their help in finding their missing child. The child wandered off during one of their blackouts and hasn't been seen since. The players can choose to assist in the search, which could lead them into dangerous areas of the Crawler or even out into the desert.

4. A sudden sandstorm hits, causing chaos and confusion among the passengers. The players must help evacuate everyone to safety and ensure that no one gets left behind.

5. The players stumble upon a secret meeting between Karach and his partners, where they discuss their plans in more detail. The players must listen in without being seen or heard, gathering valuable information on Karach's intentions.

6. While exploring one of the rooms, a trap is triggered and locks them inside. They must solve a puzzle or find a way to disable the trap before it becomes dangerous or potentially lethal.

8. One of the passengers claims they saw something strange outside during their blackout, but no one believes them. The players can investigate further and potentially discover a hidden threat lurking in the desert.

9. A malfunction in one of the crawler's systems causes it to veer off course. The players must help the crew fix the issue and get back on track before they end up lost in the desert.

10. As the players explore the Crawler, they discover a hidden message that hints at a conspiracy among some of the passengers. They must uncover the truth and decide who they can trust.

Describe the Puzzel, concrete steps, and solution, not just "they need to solve the puzzel", design it so that the player background tie into it:

Generate a 3 Werewolf encounter for a 4 player lvl 1 Party, they get help from the Priestess.

Statblock must be toned down for lvl 1 (new players):

### Werewolf Pack

*Medium humanoid (human, shapechanger), chaotic evil*

**Armor Class** 12

**Hit Points** 16 (3d8 + 3)

**Speed** 30 ft. (40 ft. in wolf form)

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 (+2) | 13 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 8 (-1) |

**Skills** Perception +2, Stealth +3

**Senses** passive Perception 12

**Languages** Common (can't speak in wolf form)

**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP)

***Shapechanger.*** The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC and hit points, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The werewolf has advantage on [[Perception)](Wisdom (Perception|Wisdom (Perception)]].md) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

#### Actions

***Multiattack (Humanoid Form Only).*** The werewolf makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws or shortsword.

***Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution [[Saving Throws.md|saving throw]] or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.

***Claws (Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.

***Shortsword (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

To tone down the encounter for a level 1 party, you can reduce the werewolf's hit points to 12 and remove the curse effect from its bite attack. Additionally, you can adjust the number of werewolves in the pack to provide a suitable challenge for your players.

come up with something unique for each player:

Malia: Elf Bard

- Malia discovers a hidden compartment in one of the rooms that contains a special musical instrument. When played, the instrument has the power to calm enraged creatures, including werewolves. This can be a useful tool for the party if they find themselves in combat with the werewolf pack.

Brummelchen: Dwarf Warrior

- Brummelchen finds an ancient dwarven battle axe hidden away in a locked room. The axe has been enchanted to deal extra damage against lycanthropes, making it a powerful weapon against the werewolf pack.

Liaphine: Wood Elf Sorcerer

- Liaphine stumbles upon an old spellbook containing rare and powerful spells related to shape-shifting and transformation. These spells could give her an advantage in combat against the werewolves or provide useful utility abilities for the party.

Teru: Tortle Monk

- Teru discovers a set of ancient tortle martial arts scrolls that contain special techniques for fighting lycanthropes. These techniques grant him increased accuracy and damage when attacking werewolves, making him a formidable opponent in combat.

I want the door to the Control room to be locked and the machineroom to have a puzzle to open the door again, design a puzzle where the players need to go into the machine room and trigger the door to open

The player have to combine 2 types of wires and a modifier

Action wires, Target Wires and

"Activate"

"Reduce"

"Enlarge"

Targets:

"Doors"

"Logs"

"Security"

"Legs"

modifiers

## Notes from Session 2
- Priestes is a bit crazy
- Players rolled Wisdom save to remember last "Drunk Night" and found out that they did not know Krach before yesterday 
- in secrete Krach yesterday tried to drug the priestes but accidently drugged everyone else
- players stepped into their room and confronted fought and won
- players didn't remember there were 3 members
- Priestes found it interesting that they wanted to steal artifact
- Krach was from the [[The Goats.md|Goats]] and was hired to steal artifact, then redirect crawler to [[crystal Forrest]] to deliver the Artifact to the [[Quorri]] who claim ownership of the Artifact (old relict)
- Artifact is used by [[Zarinesh]] Priests to reconfigure matter in a new form
- last werwolf (twin of the other werwolf in tiefling) was in controll room they needed the puzzle to solve
- werwolf was killed but he stirred party to [[Quorri]] ambush, who are surrounding the crawler
- Priestes used artifact to modify crawler and players have to decide on what to change about the crawler and what part they now want to controll. ends in a big "Kaiju battle" between the crawler and the Quorri Ambush
- Players are deciding to: add a railgun, add a moving shield, add sword arms and more jump power

Karach should be displaying overly happy tendencies that shift once discovered

Architecture:

Crawler is a giant walking four legged creature with four legs that has 4 Floors. top floor is only the command deck, below is a bar with a outside oval walkway leading around the entire bar, north are stairs with leading down, to the door to the 1 floor where Sleeping Quarters, Public room, Kitchen and Storage are. inside another staircase leads further down to the machine room. 

I Imagine the adventure to flow like this:

- Players awake in bar, not knowing how they got here, karach is explaining how they agreed to getting paid to steal the artifact 
- Players can trust Karach and steal the artifact or protect the priestes
- A little drone enters the bar (foreshaddowing big drones)
- players go outside and fight 3 big drones
	- one tries to escape, if it manages, later a giant drone storm will dawn
- Players can sus out Karach by listening in quarters -> Confront -> Karach does not want to leave traces -> fight two werewolfs
- Barmaid warns of Drones, tells players about mana seeking stuff 
- Players can talk to Indal who will tell them great party yesterday -> maybe conflicting information
- Players could still fight against Priestes, Quorri will help them fend of swarm by using artifact
- If Werewolfs are slain Quorri raid arives and kaiju battle  

Those are notes from my previous Game. completely reformat and streamline this to be a propper dnd adventure Module. Dont try to finish by the end but just write as far as gpt tokens allow you :

The werolf twins are called "Oriat" and "Esron". Oriat is running next to Karach, Esron killed the navigator in the 4 floor and is steering the crawler. throughout the adventure you can have Oriat tipping the Crawler a bitt and the whole room shaking. use that especially when the players are first not knowing they are in a crawler and have oriat in the voice of the navigator excuse for the ruccus every time. Oriat will also try to shake off the players if they try to open the door to his room with force.
