## Chapter 2: The Explosive Lab Course and the Unknown Posession.

	- They got a book with informations about various magical stones to make magical compounds for alchemy and other.
	- They should start making arcane powder.
	- When all the students look for their ingredients there is a conflict between [[Rinera]] and [[Trent]] which is fired by [[Cyrus]]. This caused [[Trent]] to escalate and use his fire magic. He destroys a table and most of [[Gil]] s notes. He is forced by Zastrath to go to the Principal. Zastrath leaves with him and [[Rinera]], [[Winston]] and [[Cyrus]] are alone with [[Tuna]] in the class. They have the assignment to create arcane powder. 
	- [[Winston]] uses the [[moonlight extruder]] to grind some gems. Puts Skybreath into it and let it react with the [[Aurora Burner]]. Then with the Arcane Destillation he extracted the arcanol.
	- [[Cyrus]] tried something similiar, he used the Golem Fist to grind but he didnt used Skybreath. He used the Kenku Lance to heat it up and saw that [[Winston]] s Arcanol Idea was better. So he went with him
- [[Rinera]], [[Winston]] and [[Cyrus]] made friends with [[Tuna]] 

1 year later  3rd year of School

- [[Rinera]], [[Winston]] and [[Cyrus]] starting with their first mandatory Scryer Course . Professor Waespetor is leading them through the course. 
- They learn the essentials, but when [[Rinera]] should show them some Scrying with a magic ball she gets posessed by an unknown force, preaching a dark prophecy:
Erlischt das glühen am Tor des Lichtes, wird es fallen
Die Götter werden sich nehmen was ihnen gehört
Ihr Zorn wird auf ewig die Welt von [[Skoria]] umkrallen
Das Ende aller Zeiten kommt, diese Welt wird zerstört
- [[Rinera]] should go to the Principal the next day.
- It was uncommon that [[Gil]] was not there, therefore he is never late for class.
	- they searched for [[Gil]] 
	- they found him in his Dorm, the lock was melted, a bird said that he saw a strange fiery light the night before
	- [[Gil]] was poisoned by the [[Trumpet Vine]], maybe [[Trent]] has poisoned him.
	- [[Trent]] left the school, he was not seen again and it was impossible to get a good hint.
- The next day they went to Skripi (the principal) and got a mission.
- They need to create a Mythal and carry it to Rockwell, to master [[Anitor the Arcane]] and then to [[Lichtor]]
- They need to go as 3. They decided to take [[Tuna]] with them.
