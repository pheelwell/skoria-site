## Religion
### Ideals

Followers of Varuún believe that true wisdom comes from understanding the nature of death and undeath. They see mortality as a barrier that separates beings from ultimate knowledge. By transcending this barrier through undeath or by studying it closely through necromancy, they gain access to hidden truths that others cannot perceive.

### Worshipers

Necromancers are drawn to Varuún's teachings, as well as scholars who study mortality and those who have been touched by undeath themselves. These worshipers are often secretive, hiding their allegiance to The Death from those who fear or misunderstand their beliefs.

### Temples

Temples dedicated to Varuún are typically hidden away in crypts or catacombs beneath graveyards, where the veil between life and death is thin. They are adorned with skulls and other symbols of mortality, and shrouded in darkness to reflect the mysteries of undeath.

## Lore
### History

Varuún's origins are as enigmatic as the deity itself. Some believe Varuún was born from the shadows that linger between life and death, while others speculate that they were once mortal, gaining godhood through extensive study of mortality and undeath. The true nature of Varuún's beginnings remains a closely guarded secret.

### The Veil Between Life and Death

The concept of a veil separating the living from the dead is central to Varuún's teachings. Worshipers believe that by studying this veil, they can learn to manipulate it, potentially even transcending it to become undead beings themselves.

## Roleplaying
### Goals and Motivations

Varuún seeks to spread knowledge of death and undeath across the world, unlocking hidden truths for those who dare to embrace their teachings. They may guide their followers to discover ancient tombs or hidden necromantic texts, hoping that such knowledge will further their cause.

In opposition to deities of life and healing, Varuún may also work through their followers to undermine these powers. This could involve sabotaging efforts to heal a plague-ridden city or attempting to subvert religious orders devoted to life-affirming gods.

### Appearance and Visions

When manifesting before worshipers or sending visions, Varuún often appears as a figure shrouded in dark robes with only a skull visible beneath its hood. Their presence is accompanied by an eerie silence as even the sounds of breathing cease within their vicinity.

### Personality Traits

Varuún embodies enigma and mystery. They rarely speak directly but instead communicate through riddles or cryptic messages. Their demeanor is cold and detached - fitting for a deity associated with death - but they are not without a certain dark humor.

### Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws

Worshipers of Varuún value the pursuit of knowledge above all else. They are often driven by a desire to understand the nature of death and undeath and are willing to go to great lengths to uncover secrets hidden from the living. However, this relentless pursuit can lead them down dangerous paths, risking their own lives or the lives of others in search of answers.

## Trivia
- Varuún's holy symbol is an hourglass with a skull on top, representing the inevitable passage of time and its connection to death.
- Some followers believe that Varuún themself has transcended mortality and become an undead being, while others think they remain mortal but have unlocked the secrets of immortality.
- There is a small faction within Varuún's worshipers who seek to bring about an age of undeath, believing it will free mortals from the limitations imposed by life.
