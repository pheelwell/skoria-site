They are often constructed using advanced materials and building techniques, creating a structure that seems to defy the laws of conventional engineering. The overall design is fluid and dynamic, with smooth curves and organic shapes that flow seamlessly into one another.

Exterior walls may be covered in a metallic sheen or embedded with living plants that intertwine with the structure itself. The entrance to the temple is typically marked by a large, intricately designed gate made from a combination of metal and living vines.

Inside, the temple's layout is labyrinthine, filled with interconnected chambers dedicated to various forms of research and experimentation. Large windows and skylights allow natural light to filter in, illuminating the space in a soft glow.
