[Carillea](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Nether%20Plane/Gods/Carillea) represents the winds of _change_ and _exploration_, encouraging mortals to embrace curiosity and venture into the unknown. Their domain includes adaptability, the pursuit of discovery, and the restlessness that drives innovation. Carillea is the patron of travelers, explorers, and visionaries who dare to seek out uncharted territories, whether they are physical, intellectual, or emotional.

- **Symbolism**: Carillea's winds are said to carry forgotten songs, lost memories, or whispers from distant lands. They are often depicted as a figure clad in flowing garments, blending seamlessly with the horizon.
- **Virtues**: Courage, curiosity, and the drive to grow beyond one‚Äôs current state.
- **Conflict**: Their influence can sometimes lead to dissatisfaction, restlessness, or a perpetual search for something unattainable.
