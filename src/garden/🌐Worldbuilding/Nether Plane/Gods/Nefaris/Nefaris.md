>[!info](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Skoria), Nefaris is the embodiment of order and hierarchy—a master of infernal contracts and soul-bound deals. He ensures that every diabolical agreement is backed by stringent terms and conditions.

## Overview

In the foreboding plane Axirex in the [Nether Plane](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Nether%20Plane), Nefaris presides with an iron fist over a vast labyrinthine bureaucracy. Likened to an immense corporate entity, this domain operates with legions of devils vying for supremacy within their ranks, each motivated by the unyielding desire to ascend the infernal hierarchy.

Under Nefaris' meticulous gaze, [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Skoria) is partitioned into seven specialized divisions. Each one adept in distinct facets of contractual subterfuge and manipulation—overseen by formidable lieutenants who answer only to the Archdevil himself.

## The Seven Divisions
1. **Division of Souls**: Masters at procuring mortal souls through intricate bargains, this division crafts seductive contracts designed to prey upon individual desires or fears.
   
2. **Division of Loopholes**: Practitioners of legal deception, their contracts are laced with ensnaring clauses—near impossible for mortals to honor without succumbing to cleverly disguised pitfalls.
   
3. **Division of Punishments**: In this division, the dire repercussions for contract infringement are concocted; punishments span from perpetual suffering to more insidious psychological torments tailored to each sufferer's psyche.
   
4. **Division of Dominion**: Charged with extending Nefaris' sway over realms far and wide, they bind not only single souls but also entire nations or collectives under his dark edict.
   
5. **Division of Labor**: Focused on demonic efficiency, this division drafts binding service contracts for lesser demons and rigorously monitors their adherence to sinister objectives.
   
6. **Division of Infernal Alliances**: This group specializes in forging pacts among Hell's factions and other extraplanar entities, positioning Nefaris advantageously through complex agreements involving multiple parties.
   
7. **Division of Archived Knowledge**: Guardians of a vast repository containing all past contracts, they provide consultations on historical precedents and possess potent secrets that can turn the tide in contract negotiations.

## Role within [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Skoria)

Nefaris stands as a figure both revered and feared within his dominion—an Archdevil who prizes dutifulness and cunning but displays no mercy for failure or defiance. His subjects operate knowing that ascension could mean substantial power gains while demotion spells out aeons in monotonous servitude—or far worse fates.

>[!secret] Rumors whisper that those bold enough to strike a bargain directly with Nefaris might gain immeasurable boons; yet such deals come at costs so exorbitant that only those blind with desperation or ambition would dare engage him.

Within his dominion and beyond its fiery borders into the mortal planes, Nefaris' influence subtly permeates as he orchestrates his minions' infiltration into pivotal roles—all partaking in his grand stratagem bound by inviolable contracts inked in either blood or soulfire.
