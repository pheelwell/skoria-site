Half-God's: 

They are actually half a god. They got their powers from a god themselves. If they are in the [Nether Plane](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/Nether%20Plane) they are blocked by the great Barrier, just like normal gods were.

Chosen Ones: 

Are Human beeings which are in possesion of an artifact of power or are blessed for a limited time with the power of a god.
