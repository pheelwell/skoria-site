# Servants of the God

## Half-Gods
- Beings empowered directly by a god (effectively half divine)
- When in the [Nether Plane](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Nether%20Plane), they are blocked by the great Barrier, like normal gods

## Chosen Ones
- Mortals who possess a divine artifact or receive a temporary blessing
- Act as agents of their patron deity in the mortal realm
