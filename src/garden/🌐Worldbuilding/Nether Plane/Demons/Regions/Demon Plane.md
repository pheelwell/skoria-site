This plane was created by accident. It is not a really plane. This plane describes the void between the other planes and was created by the gods when they shattered the material plane at the event of the [The Shattering](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/The%20Shattering). 

This plane is the home of the miscreated demons which live in between the planes and search for a place to live and subjugate other species to show their brutal power.
