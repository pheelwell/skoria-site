Amidst the chaos of [[The Shattering]] the very fabric of divinity was rent asunder. From the remnants of this divine energy, a new, sinister lifeform emerged: demons. These entities are not mere villains to be vanquished; they are incarnations of the most profound horrors imaginable.

>[!tip] 
>As you navigate your players through a world where these demonic forces lurk, remember that their origins are deeply tied to the divine beings that fell during [[The Shattering]]. This connection can lead to intriguing plot points and complex character interactions.

## Quick Reference:
- **Origins**: Demons formed during [[The Shattering]] from leftover divine energy.
- **Nature**: Embodiments of horror concepts.
- **Structure**: Unpredictable, sometimes reflecting dark aspects of their progenitor gods.
- **Organization**: Divided into "Families" with shared themes; breed within the [[Nether Plane]].

## Demon Types:

### Leviathans

![[Leviathans.png]]

[[Leviathans]] are colossal creatures, often resembling the most terrifying aspects of sea monsters and other behemoths of legend. These titanic demons embody the existential horror of the unknown—emerging from places where light fears to tread, their very presence is enough to overwhelm the senses with crippling dread. They are not just physical entities; they represent a primal fear deeply rooted in every living being—the fear of being insignificant in the face of boundless, indifferent forces. [[Leviathans]] rarely interact directly with mortals, yet their influence extends across realms, manifesting as crushing despair or an oppressive sense that one's demise could be lurking just beneath the surface of reality.

### Lurkers

Lurkers are insidious demons that exist on the fringes of awareness, always seeming to disappear when directly observed. They are masters of psychological terror, exploiting the innate human fear of what cannot be seen or understood. These creatures weave themselves into the fabric of their victim's reality, distorting perception until trust in one's own senses is eroded. They are shapeshifters and manipulators who delight in stalking their prey from within shadows or creeping through reflections. The primary weapon of a Lurker is its ability to induce paralyzing fear by suggesting a presence that is always near yet never fully revealed.

### Infernals

![[Infernals.png]]

[[Infernals]] are chaotic entities that embody destruction and wrath. Appearing as fearsome beings wreathed in flames or forged from molten rock and ash, they are often depicted with horns or wings—iconography associated with devilish lore across countless cultures. [[Infernals]] thrive on conflict and upheaval; they savor the scent of burning empires as much as a wildfire’s roar through ancient woodlands. To conjure an Infernal is to invite catastrophe: they will turn order into disorder with an explosive temper that can shatter cities and scorch earth. Their influence spreads far beyond physical devastation; they ignite tempers and fan the embers of hatred within communities.

### Enigmas

Enigmas exist purely to befuddle and bewilder; their forms defy comprehension, fractal patterns and impossible geometries that strain mortal minds to breaking points. Enigma demons do not subscribe to any consistent shape or logic—they might appear as bewildering mazes floating in midair or creatures whose features shift so rapidly that no observer can agree on what was actually seen. Encounters with these demons leave victims lost within their own thoughts, unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy as madness encroaches like ivy creeping up crumbling walls.

### Corruptors

Corruptors represent decay at its most aggressive—a cancerous growth spreading across life itself. Their forms often mimic natural organisms but twisted grotesquely: plants with flesh-like petals oozing pus instead of nectar; insectoid creatures with too many eyes or limbs growing in unsettling patterns; animals fused together in sickening amalgamations. Corruptors bring rot wherever they tread; crops whither at their touch, water turns foul when they pass by, and sickness spreads like wildfire through once-healthy populations.

### Tormentors

Tormentors revel in pain—not merely physical but emotional anguish too profound for tears alone. They take perverse pleasure in constructing elaborate scenarios designed exclusively for suffering: mental illusions where loved ones betray repeatedly; corporeal cages where flesh is prodded until it can scream no more; spectral whispers driving wedges through strongest bonds until isolation seems like sweet release compared to constant torment these fiends inflict.

### Devourers

Devourers personify gluttony unchecked—a relentless pursuit to consume without end nor satisfaction ever attained. Often depicted as gaping maws surrounded by writhing tentacles or masses engulfing everything around them without prejudice—flesh, bone, stone—all dissolve equally within ravenous voids that serve as bodies for these demons.


## Origin

- Origin of Demons is not really known to Mortals, but it is one of the key reasons the Gods do not fight each other or intervein in the Mortal realm
- Demons are formed from the battles between Gods during the Shattering, where through the suffered Wounds their Essence leaked into the Nether. these cancerous Nexuses of energy were lost In-between the voids of the Netherplane
-  For example [[Asmadan]] Anger spawned the beeings of into the Infernals
