# The Prophecy

As the Beast lifts his paw,

the broken sword will rise again,

bringing eyed pawns to change the shattered land.

But beware, for alliances will gather,

and the echoes of the past shall resurface,

threatening to shatter the world anew.

Only through unity and sacrifice,

can the looming darkness be vanquished,

and balance restored to the realms of gods and mortals.
