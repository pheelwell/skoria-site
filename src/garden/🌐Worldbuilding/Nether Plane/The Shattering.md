title: The Shattering
---

The Shattering was a cataclysmic event resulting from a dispute between two groups of gods. In the process of this dispute, most of the population of [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CGeneral/Skoria) was wiped out, resetting the whole civilization and wiping out entire species. 

- 85% of the civilization was wiped from [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CGeneral/Skoria) 
- The Maelstrom was an event caused by a fight between VarÂ´uun and Leptys. 
- Most of the technological knowledge was lost; only simple settlements survived
- [Asmadan](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Asmadan) initially sided with the chaotic gods but later switched sides, leading to the death of [Umbrial](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Umbrial) by shattering him into pieces
- [Zarinesh](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Zarinesh) lost his left hand
- Gods brought pieces of themselves into the world leaving parts of their powers to wield by Mortals
- The ruins of ancient cities destroyed during The Shattering hold valuable artifacts and relics that adventurers may seek, but they are also filled with dangerous creatures and traps
- [Arathor](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Arathor) builds a barrier with the help of [Lar](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Lar) between the [Nether Plane](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/Nether%20Plane) and [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CGeneral/Skoria) out of the remains of [Umbrial](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Umbrial)
- Gods agree not to directly interfere with one another to prevent the death of another God and block themselves from doing so by [???]
- A group known as The Remnants may hold secrets about pre-shattering technology and knowledge, but they are elusive and their true intentions are unknown.
- A prophecy speaks of a time when [Umbrial](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Umbrial) will return from his grave to bring about a second Shattering unless stopped by heroes chosen by the gods. This prophecy is known as the [Prophecy of Shadows](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CThings/Prophecy%20of%20Shadows) and is a driving force for many adventurers who seek to become these legendary heroes and prevent another cataclysm.
