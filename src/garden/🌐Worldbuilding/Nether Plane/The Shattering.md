The Shattering was a cataclysmic event resulting from a dispute between two groups of gods. In the process of this dispute, most of the population of [[Skoria]] was wiped out, resetting the whole civilization and wiping out entire species. 

- 85% of the civilization was wiped from [[Skoria]] 
- The Maelstrom was an event caused by a fight between VarÂ´uun and Leptys. 
- Most of the technological knowledge was lost; only simple settlements survived
- [[Asmadan]] initially sided with the chaotic gods but later switched sides, leading to the death of [[Umbrial]] by shattering him into pieces
- [[Zarinesh]] lost his left hand
- Gods brought pieces of themselves into the world leaving parts of their powers to wield by Mortals
- The ruins of ancient cities destroyed during The Shattering hold valuable artifacts and relics that adventurers may seek, but they are also filled with dangerous creatures and traps
- [[Arathor]] builds a barrier with the help of [[Lar]] between the [[Nether Plane]] and [[Skoria]] out of the remains of [[Umbrial]]
- Gods agree not to directly interfere with one another to prevent the death of another God and block themselves from doing so by [???]
- A group known as [[The Remnants]] may hold secrets about pre-shattering technology and knowledge, but they are elusive and their true intentions are unknown.
- A prophecy speaks of a time when [[Umbrial]] will return from his grave to bring about a second Shattering unless stopped by heroes chosen by the gods. This prophecy is known as the [[Prophecy of Shadows]] and is a driving force for many adventurers who seek to become these legendary heroes and prevent another cataclysm.
