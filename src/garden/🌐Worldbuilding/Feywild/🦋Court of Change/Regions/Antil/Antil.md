_In the depths of the [Feywild](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Feywild), where the ethereal [Court of Change](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Feywild/%F0%9F%A6%8BCourt%20of%20Change/Court%20of%20Change) holds sway, lies Antil – a town not built, but grown and un-grown in an eternal dance with time._

## The Cycle of Eternity

Antil, ruled by Istak'lon, the Archfey of Autumn, exists within a colossal cavern. Here, luminescent fungi light walls etched with tales of impermanence. Every fourteen years, a mystical **Verdant Surge** sweeps around the chamber, spawning forests of elderwood that touch the cavern's roof, only to be consumed by the trailing **Ashen Wane**, leaving fertile ash in its wake. Even Antil’s buildings dance with the cycle, built to collapse gracefully, their materials reclaimed by the earth. Within Antil exists a unique view on [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Skoria), with death not being the end but just another change.

## Istak’lon, Autumn's Master

The Archfey Istak'lon, a being of constant metamorphosis, embodies the essence of the town. From his floating island at the cavern's heart, he oversees the ever-turning cycle. Istak’lon, from the [Court of Change](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Feywild/%F0%9F%A6%8BCourt%20of%20Change/Court%20of%20Change), reveres decay as a necessary step to new life, ruling over spore-drunk pixies, melancholic dryads, and beetle-riddled treants.

## Life Rooted in Flux

Antil’s dynamic society consists of satyrs, eladrin, myconids, and mortal artisans, forever rebuilding and embracing change. Facets of life in Antil include:

*   **Rebirth Festivals:** Every fourteen years, the **Harvestmoot** celebrates the cycle's completion. Masked revelers search for cycle-seeds amidst the ruins of the old, magical fragments containing the wave's fading essence.
*   **Decaywardens:** Druidic caretakers navigating the **Ashen Wane**, harvesting resources and guiding decomposition.
*   **Architecture of Ephemera:** Homes are designed for collapse, wealth is found in adaptability, and status is measured in rebuilt artistry.

## Notable Locales

*   **The Floating Heart:** Istak'lon's island sanctuary mirrors the cavern's cycle. Pilgrims brave living Rootstalk Bridges for a blessing.
*   **The Gloomveil Fields:** Fantastical crops straddle life and death, nurtured by the Verdant Surge but haunted by the Ashen Wane’s mists.
*   **The Chamber of Whispers:** The dead linger here, offering power at the cost of one’s soul bound to Antil.

## Dangers and Secrets

*   **The Withering:** The Ashen Wane ages mortals decades in moments, gifting those who survive with rapidly aging visions.
*   **Symbiotic Predators:** Rotwolves and sporehawks hunt within decaying zones.
*   **The Unbroken:** A cult seeking to halt Antil’s cycle, tolerated for now by Istak’lon as "a fascinating blight."
