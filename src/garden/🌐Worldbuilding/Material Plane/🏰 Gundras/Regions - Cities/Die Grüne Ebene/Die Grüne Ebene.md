## Geography

Green Plains is a vast expanse of lush, rolling grasslands, interspersed with occasional rocky outcrops. The landscape is almost entirely green, with thick grass carpeting the land as far as the eye can see. In the center of Green Plains stands the magnificent Tree of Sori, a colossal tree that reaches beyond the clouds, serving as a focal point for the region’s geography and spiritual life.

### Notable Settlements

1. **Sori’s Heart** - The central hub, located around the Tree of Sori. This area is the religious and most visited part of Green Plains. It features settlements arround the tree of Sori, the God of Nature, with people dedicated their lives to her. The Tree of Sori is protected by Sori’s Guardians, paladins imbued with natural magic who serve as both protectors and spiritual guides.
   
2. **Lakeside Grove** - The second hub, characterized by small lakes that create a unique grass swamp environment. This area is teeming with wildlife adapted to the wetland conditions, making it a more dangerous but ecologically rich part of Green Plains.

3. **Sun Elves' Refuge** - The third hub, where the grasslands meet a giant wall built by the Sun Elves. This area has more rocks and hills compared to the rest of Green Plains. It is home to a small settlement and refuges, particularly for those who are not permitted entry into the nearby region of Aravoss.

### Scenery and Climate

Green Plains enjoys a temperate climate with mild winters and warm, sunny summers. The vast grasslands create a serene and bright environment, particularly stunning when the wind causes waves of green to ripple across the landscape. The area around the lakes and grass swamps is more humid, creating misty mornings and lush vegetation. The region near the Sun Elves' wall has a slightly more rugged terrain, with rocky hills providing a stark contrast to the smooth grasslands.

### Flora and Fauna

**Flora:**

- **Tree of Sori**: A massive, ancient tree with powerful magical properties.
- **Tallgrass**: The dominant plant species, tall and verdant, covering most of the plains.
- **Water Lilies**: Found in the lakes and grass swamps, adding bursts of color to the wetlands.
- **Glow Moss**: A bioluminescent moss that grows near the Tree of Sori and around the lakes, providing a mystical light at night.

**Fauna:**

- **Plains Deer**: Graceful creatures that graze on the tall grass.
- **Grass Swamp Serpents**: Dangerous predators found in the wetlands, known for their camouflage.
- **Sky Hawks**: Birds of prey that nest in the Tree of Sori and hunt across the plains.
- **Rock Badgers**: Small, hardy mammals living among the rocky outcrops near the Sun Elves' wall.

## Population

The population of Green Plains is diverse, consisting of druids, nature lovers, and refugees seeking a simpler life away from more politically complex regions. The inhabitants are spread across the three main hubs, with Sori’s Heart being the most populated due to its religious significance.

### Culture and Religion

The culture of Green Plains is deeply connected to nature and the worship of Sori, the God of Nature. Festivals and rituals centered around the Tree of Sori are common, with the changing seasons marked by elaborate celebrations. Sori’s Guardians play a crucial role in maintaining the spiritual and natural balance, acting as both priests and protectors. The people here live in harmony with the land, practicing sustainable farming and magical enhancement of crops.

### Politics and Economy

The economy of Green Plains is primarily agrarian, supplemented by trade in magical herbs and natural artifacts. The region is self-sufficient, with a strong emphasis on communal living and resource sharing. Politically, Green Plains is a theocracy governed by the High Druid Council, with Sori’s Guardians enforcing laws and maintaining order.

### History and Origin

Green Plains has ancient origins, believed to be the birthplace of Sori’s worship. The Tree of Sori has stood for millennia, drawing pilgrims and scholars from far and wide. The region has seen various factions attempt to harness its natural power, but the steadfast Guardians have always protected its sanctity. The Sun Elves built their wall centuries ago to create a boundary, both to protect their own lands and to acknowledge the sacred nature of Green Plains.

In recent history, the influx of refugees from Aravoss has added a new dimension to the region’s demographic, creating a more complex social fabric while maintaining the core values of nature worship and community.
