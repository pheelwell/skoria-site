## The Mai Bos: Guardians of the Bosque Forest

### General Information

The Mai Bos are a revered group of nature guardians rooted in the Bosque Forest. They are named in honor of their founder, Mai, a kind-hearted huntress and the daughter of the village chief. According to legend, Mai was blessed at birth by a powerful druidess of Sori, granting her an extraordinary connection to nature. This connection, along with her nurturing spirit, made her the ideal leader of the Mai Bos.

### Culture

The culture of the Mai Bos is deeply entwined with the rhythms of nature. They revere the forest and the creatures that inhabit it, seeing themselves as the custodians and protectors of the natural order. Under Mai's guidance, only those with a strong connection to nature are inducted into the ranks of the Mai Bos.

A significant aspect of their culture is the close bond each member forms with a specific animal native to the Bosque Forest. This bond is not merely emotional but often mental, as exemplified by Mai and her extraordinary wolfhound. These animals are not just companions but partners with whom the Mai Bos share a symbiotic relationship.

### Society

The Mai Bos serve as both warriors and healers of the forest. They wear ritual gloves adorned with a metal plate engraved with the symbol of the animal to which they are bonded. This glove signifies their status and their commitment to nature.

Most Mai Bos reside in the nearby city of Gaban, from where they organize their patrols and duties in the forest. The presence of the Mai Bos has transformed Gaban into a center of harmony between humans and nature. The inhabitants respect and support the Mai Bos in their mission, and many young people dream of one day becoming a Mai Bos themselves.

#### Bond with Animals

Each Mai Bos forms a unique bond with a particular animal of the forest. This connection goes beyond mere friendship and is considered sacred. Through these animals, the Mai Bos gain insights into nature, can detect impending dangers, and communicate with the wilderness. This partnership enables them to effectively protect and nurture the forest.

#### Conclusion

The Mai Bos are more than just guardians of the forest; they are the living embodiment of balance and harmony between humans and nature. Their rituals, their bonds with animals, and their code of respect and protection make them a unique and essential force within the Bosque Forest. Under Mai's wise leadership and through their deep connections with their animal partners, the Mai Bos ensure that the Bosque Forest thrives and flourishes while preserving the deep secrets and wonders of nature.
