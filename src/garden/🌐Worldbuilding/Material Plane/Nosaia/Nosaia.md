- Rekar are forced to use Magic to create Crops and Food, Nos'iren are magic averse and use traditional methods
- Rekar have artificer Background, Nos'iren    
It seems like you're describing a fantasy world with contrasting regions and cultures, and it's a great basis for a rich, detailed setting. Let's expand on that with a bit of world-building:

**Nosaia: The Continent of Contrast**

Nosaia, a land of stark dichotomy, is split into two main regions: Rekar and Nos'iren. This continent exists on the planet Skoria, a world where magic intertwines with the fabric of reality, and the principles of Cycle and Balance govern all aspects of life.

**Rekar: The Barren Land of Ingenuity**

Rekar is a region cursed with arid landscapes and perpetual droughts, making life here a constant battle against the harsh elements. The people of Rekar, known as Rekarians, are resilient and resourceful, having turned to magic as their salvation. They have developed a unique artificer background, combining their knowledge of arcane arts with technological prowess to coax life from the unforgiving soil.

Through their ingenuity, Rekarians have created intricate magical systems that draw moisture from the air or deep beneath the ground to irrigate their fields. Their crops are more than just food; they are symbols of their mastery over their environment, magical constructs that sustain their society. Despite the desolation that surrounds them, Rekarians have built a civilization that thrives on innovation and adaptation.

**Nos'iren: The Harmonic Sanctuary**

In stark contrast, Nos'iren is a lush, verdant paradise reminiscent of ancient Asian cultures both in its aesthetic beauty and its deep-rooted traditions. The people of Nos'iren, the Nos'ireni, live in harmony with their environment and hold a deep-seated aversion to magic which they view as a disruptive force that could disturb the natural order.

Their farming techniques are time-tested and rely on an intimate knowledge of the land. They follow the cycles of seasons, planting and harvesting according to age-old rhythms that have sustained them for generations. Their culture celebrates balance and simplicity, finding beauty in the tranquility of their verdant forests, rolling hills, and serene rice paddies.

The Nos'ireni architecture reflects their philosophy: structures built with natural materials that blend seamlessly into the landscape, featuring flowing water gardens and tranquil meditation spaces. They favor peaceful coexistence over progress and have developed martial arts not only for self-defense but as a way to maintain personal discipline and inner peace.

**The Dichotomy of Nosaia**

The two regions of Nosaia are embodiments of Cycle and Balance. Rekar represents the cycle of innovation and adaptation—the never-ending struggle to overcome adversity through change. Nos'iren represents balance—the harmonious existence with nature and the preservation of tradition.

This dichotomy leads to unique interactions between Rekarians and Nos'ireni. Trade between the two regions is common, as each has resources the other values. Rekarians may seek herbal medicines or natural textiles from Nos'iren, while the Nos'ireni might find certain magical tools or artificer-crafted items from Rekar to be useful, despite their general aversion to magic.

The underlying tension between progress and preservation is a constant theme in Nosaian society. While magic has allowed Rekar to survive in a hostile environment, some question whether such reliance on arcane forces is sustainable or respectful of the greater balance. Conversely, Nos'ireni's adherence to tradition is tested as the world around them evolves.

 i want to blend roman and japanese aestetics, how could i describe the Nos'ireni for midjoruney prompts?

Blending Roman and Japanese aesthetics for the Nos'ireni in your world-building prompts for Midjourney can result in a unique and visually striking culture. Here's how you might describe the Nos'ireni for such prompts:

**Nos'ireni: The Fusion of Elegance and Strength**

The Nos'ireni, guardians of Nos'iren's verdant splendor, have cultivated a society where the stoic grandeur of ancient Rome converges with the serene beauty of traditional Japan. Their culture is a tapestry woven from the threads of two distinct civilizations, harmonizing into a cohesive and captivating whole.

**Architecture and Infrastructure**

Their cities are a marvel of architectural synthesis; grand stone aqueducts inspired by Roman engineering traverse the landscape, ensuring water flows to nourish their terraced rice fields reminiscent of those found in rural Japan. The central forums are spacious plazas lined with statues depicting both heroic figures and ancestral spirits, where citizens gather to discuss communal matters under the shade of cherry blossoms.

Public bathhouses combine the communal aspect of Roman thermae with the ritual purity of Japanese onsen, featuring intricate mosaics and tranquil rock gardens. The roofs of their civic buildings display the gentle curves characteristic of Japanese pagodas, while their sturdy columns and facades pay homage to Roman temples and basilicas.

**Fashion and Personal Adornment**

The clothing of the Nos'ireni blends the flowing elegance of Roman togas with the structured grace of Japanese kimonos. Their garments are crafted from fine silks and linens, often adorned with patterns that tell stories of their land's history and myths. Men and women alike wear tunics or yukatas for daily wear, while more formal occasions see them in elaborate stolas or furisode, accented with intricate belts that mirror the style of Roman cinctures.

Their jewelry is an amalgamation of classical Roman goldwork and delicate Japanese lacquerware, with citizens donning bracelets, rings, and necklaces that celebrate their dual heritage. Hairstyles incorporate both the tidy buns seen in Japanese aesthetics and the ornate braids and crowns reminiscent of Roman nobility.

**Art and Culture**

The artistry of the Nos'ireni reflects their dual influences, with paintings and sculptures that blend the realism of Roman portraiture with the evocative simplicity of Japanese ink wash. Their theaters host performances that range from dramatic orations echoing the forums of Rome to subtle Noh plays that capture the essence of the human spirit.

Martial arts are practiced with a discipline that mirrors that of Roman legionaries, yet their movements are infused with the fluidity and precision of samurai swordplay. The Nos'ireni take pride in their combat arts as a form of physical poetry—a way to honor their ancestors and maintain personal balance.

**Gastronomy**

In their cuisine, robust Roman flavors meet the delicate balance of Japanese dishes. Banquets might feature sushi served alongside olives and cheese or rice wine complemented by spiced mulled drinks. Their culinary fusion is a testament to their belief in harmony—each meal is an opportunity to celebrate the diversity within their culture.

In crafting these descriptions for Midjourney prompts, you can create a richly detailed image of a society where two seemingly disparate cultures merge seamlessly into one, reflecting both the strength and grace inherent in their traditions.

In Magic: The Gathering (MTG), terms like "Goblin," "Elf," "Wizard," "Fighter," and "Horror" are all examples of creature types. Each creature card has one or more types listed on its type line, which can be used for deck-building themes, synergies, and interactions within the game.

Creature types are used to categorize creatures into various tribes or groups, and many cards have abilities that benefit or affect certain creature types. For example, a card might say "All Goblins get +1/+1," which would apply to all creatures with the Goblin type.

"Wizard," "Fighter," and "Horror" are just as much creature types as "Goblin" or "Elf." They can be the basis of tribal themes in decks, and there are spells and abilities that specifically reference these types. For instance, there might be cards that give bonuses to Wizards or cards that allow you to search your library for a Horror card.

In summary:

- "Goblin" and "Elf" are creature types associated with those respective tribes.
- "Wizard," "Fighter," and "Horror" are also creature types that can be associated with their own tribal themes or synergies within the game.

what would be creature subtypes best suited in this context?

In Magic: The Gathering, creature subtypes are specific to the broader creature types and are used to further categorize creatures within the game. However, it's important to note that what you're referring to as "subtypes" in MTG are actually just more specific creature types; in MTG terminology, all these terms are considered creature types, not subtypes. There is no distinction between "tribe" and "non-tribe" creature types in the rules; they are all simply types.

In the context of the fantasy world you're developing, you might want to consider creature types that reflect the unique aspects of your world's lore, cultures, and environment. Here are some creature types that could suit the different societies and regions of Nosaia:

**For Rekar:**

- **Artificer:** As the Rekarians have an artificer background, creatures from this region might be classified as Artificers. This would reflect their magical and technological expertise.
- **Wizard:** Given their reliance on magic for survival, Wizard would also be a suitable type for Rekarian magic users.
- **Construct:** For magically created beings or animated objects brought to life through Rekarian magic and technology.
- **Druid:** If any Rekarians use magic to directly manipulate natural elements, this type could represent their connection to the forces they harness to grow crops.

**For Nos'iren:**

- **Monk:** This type reflects the Nos'ireni’s focus on martial arts, discipline, and inner peace.
- **Samurai:** A creature type that would symbolize the Nos'ireni warriors’ honor and skill in combat.
- **Spirit:** For creatures that embody the natural beauty and ancestral reverence of Nos'iren.
- **Advisor:** Reflecting those who hold wisdom and guide others in following the traditions and harmonious ways of Nos'iren.

**For creatures native to Nosaia:**

- **Elemental:** To represent beings made up of the natural forces of Skoria, possibly embodying aspects of Cycle and Balance.
- **Beast:** For the various animals that might inhabit the lush forests of Nos'iren or the harsh landscapes of Rekar.
- **Horror:** If there are darker, more arcane or unnatural forces at play in certain parts of Nosaia, this type could represent such creatures.

Remember that in MTG, a creature can have multiple types, so a creature from Rekar might be a "Human Artificer Wizard," while one from Nos'iren could be an "Elf Monk Samurai," combining race or origin with profession or class. These creature types help players utilize synergies between cards in their decks based on shared characteristics.

what Ingame MTG Mechanics are tied to those types?

In Magic: The Gathering, certain mechanics are frequently associated with specific creature types. These mechanics often reinforce the flavor and thematic elements of the creature types they're tied to. Here are some mechanics that are commonly found with the creature types mentioned:

**Artificer:**

- **Improvise:** This mechanic allows you to tap artifacts you control to help pay for the spell's cost, reflecting an Artificer's ability to utilize tools and contraptions.
- **Fabricate:** A mechanic that lets you choose between creating Servo artifact creature tokens or putting +1/+1 counters on a creature, symbolizing an Artificer's craftsmanship.

**Wizard:**

- **Spell Mastery:** This mechanic provides an additional effect if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard, fitting the theme of a Wizard's growing power.
- **Wizardry:** Some cards have abilities that trigger when you cast an instant or sorcery spell, emphasizing a Wizard's magical prowess.

**Construct:**

- **Modular:** This ability allows Construct creatures to enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters and transfer those counters to another artifact creature when they die, representing the reassemblable nature of Constructs.
- **Adapt:** A fitting mechanic for Constructs that can be "upgraded," Adapt allows you to pay a cost to put +1/+1 counters on a creature if it has no +1/+1 counters on it.

**Druid:**

- **Landfall:** This mechanic triggers an effect whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, which is thematic for Druids connected to the land.
- **Mana abilities:** Many Druids have abilities that generate mana, reflecting their role in nurturing growth and channeling natural energies.

**Monk:**

- **Prowess:** A mechanic that gives the creature a temporary +1/+1 boost whenever you cast a noncreature spell, symbolizing a Monk's focus and discipline.
- **Exert:** This ability represents a Monk's exertion in combat or meditation, often providing a powerful effect at the cost of not untapping during the next untap step.

**Samurai:**

- **Bushido:** A mechanic that increases a Samurai's power and toughness when blocking or blocked, representing their combat honor and skill.
- **Double strike:** Reflecting the deadly precision of Samurai in combat, creatures with double strike deal combat damage twice each combat phase.

**Spirit:**

- **Soulshift:** Spirits often have this mechanic, allowing you to return a Spirit card from your graveyard to your hand when the Spirit with Soulshift dies.
- **Flying:** Many Spirits have flying, fitting their ethereal nature and ability to soar above the battlefield.

**Advisor:**

- **Council's Judgment:** This represents Advisors' ability to sway decisions. Cards with this mechanic let players vote for outcomes that affect the game.
- **Parley:** Advisors might have this ability, which involves revealing the top card of each player's library and using that information for some communal benefit in the game.

**Elemental:**

- **Evoke:** This mechanic allows you to cast an Elemental for its evoke cost for an immediate effect but requires you to sacrifice it, illustrating the fleeting nature of Elementals.
- **Land animation:** Some Elementals can turn lands into creatures, emphasizing their connection to the earth and nature.

**Beast:**

- **Trample:** Beasts often have trample, reflecting their raw power and ability to crush through defenses.
- **Ferocious:** A mechanic that provides benefits if you control a creature with power 4 or greater, which fits the theme of intimidating Beasts.

**Horror:**

- **Fear/Intimidate/Menace:** These mechanics make it harder for opponents to block Horrors, capturing their terrifying presence on the battlefield.
- **Morph:** Horrors might have this ability, allowing them to be played face-down as a mystery creature and then turned face-up for some spine-chilling effect.

It's important to note that while these mechanics are commonly associated with certain creature types, they are not exclusive to them. Creature types and mechanics can be mixed and matched in various ways across different sets and blocks in Magic: The Gathering.

more subtypes for nos'iren

For Nos'iren, with its lush environment and cultural aversion to magic, you might focus on creature types that underscore their connection to nature, harmony, and traditional martial arts. Here are additional creature types (subtypes) that could be fitting:

**Gardener:** Reflecting those who cultivate the land using time-honored methods to produce bountiful harvests without the aid of magic.

**Healer:** For individuals skilled in the use of herbal remedies and ancient healing techniques that forego magical intervention.

**Scholar:** Representing the learned individuals who preserve the history, philosophy, and non-magical knowledge of Nos'iren.

**Fisherman:** Highlighting those who sustainably harvest the bounty of rivers and lakes, respecting the natural balance.

**Rice Farmer:** Specific to those who work the terraced paddies, a central aspect of Nos'ireni agriculture and culture.

**Craftsman/Craftswoman:** Artisans skilled in traditional methods of creating goods, from textiles to pottery, without relying on magical enhancement.

**Poet:** Individuals who capture the essence of Nos'iren's beauty and philosophy through expressive and evocative verse.

**Calligrapher:** Artists who practice the revered art form of calligraphy, embodying the elegance and discipline of Nos'ireni culture.

**Tea Master:** Connoisseurs who perfect the ceremonial preparation and presentation of tea, an important aspect of social and spiritual life in Nos'iren.

**Philosopher:** Thinkers who ponder the deeper meanings of Cycle and Balance and guide their society in living according to these principles.

**Geisha/Courtesan:** Entertainers trained in various traditional arts such as dance, music, and conversation, holding an esteemed place in Nos'iren society.

These creature types reflect various aspects of Nos'ireni life and culture. They can be used to create a vivid tapestry of a society that values tradition, harmony with nature, and a disciplined approach to life without reliance on magic.

if they are already established subtypes give a explenation about their usage ingame:

As of my last update, some of the creature subtypes you've listed for Nos'iren are not established subtypes in Magic: The Gathering (MTG). However, I can give you an idea of how similar or existing subtypes might be used in-game, and how the new subtypes could theoretically function if they were to be introduced.

**Existing Subtypes Similar to Nos'iren Concepts:**

- **Human:** A very common creature type that could be applied to most Nos'ireni characters, as it is a catch-all for human-like beings.
- **Shaman:** In MTG, Shamans are often associated with nature magic and could represent Nos'ireni healers or spiritual leaders.
- **Rogue:** This subtype often represents characters who are skilled in stealth, thievery, or espionage, but could also encompass Nos'ireni fishermen or other skilled craftsmen.
- **Warrior:** A broad subtype that can represent any martially inclined character, which would include Nos'ireni Samurai or other fighters.

**Theoretical Usage of New Subtypes for Nos'iren:**

- **Gardener/Healer:** These could function similarly to Shaman, focusing on cards that benefit from or interact with lands (for Gardener) or gain life (for Healer). For example, a Gardener creature might have an ability that allows you to search your library for a basic land card when it enters the battlefield.
  
- **Scholar/Poet/Philosopher:** These could have abilities that relate to card drawing or manipulation, representing their intellectual pursuits. A Scholar might have an ability that lets you draw a card when a certain condition is met.

- **Fisherman/Rice Farmer:** These might have landfall abilities or effects that trigger when a land enters the battlefield under your control, reflecting their connection to water and agriculture.

- **Craftsman/Craftswoman:** This subtype could interact with artifact creation or modification. A Craftsman might have an ability that allows you to create artifact tokens.

- **Calligrapher/Tea Master:** These could focus on subtle gameplay mechanics, perhaps involving tapping or untapping permanents, to reflect their disciplined and artistic nature.

- **Geisha/Courtesan:** This subtype could potentially involve enchantments or auras, enhancing other creatures or providing benefits when they enter the battlefield.

In terms of game mechanics and design space, these new subtypes would offer opportunities for players to build around certain themes or strategies. They could be designed to synergize with existing cards or mechanics in MTG that align with their thematic elements. For instance, a Rice Farmer might synergize with cards that reward you for having many lands in play, while a Healer might enhance life-gain strategies. The key is making sure the abilities of these creature types resonate with their lore and role within the world of Nosaia.

how could i use the "harvesting" mechanic to have some exile cards in the theme of white green Nosaia

In Magic: The Gathering, the concept of "Harvesting" could be represented as a mechanic that involves removing resources (in this case, "Seed Counters") to achieve a beneficial effect. For a White-Green (WG) themed deck in Nosaia, this mechanic could symbolize the cycle of sowing and reaping, growth and renewal—a theme that fits well with the colors' focus on life, community, and the natural order.

Here's an example of how the "Harvesting" mechanic could be used with a WG theme that involves exiling cards:

**Harvesting Mechanic Concept:**

- **Seed Counter:** You place Seed Counters on certain permanents (creatures, lands, enchantments) to represent them 'growing'.
- **Harvest:** This is an activated ability that you can use by removing a specific number of Seed Counters from your permanents. The effect of the Harvest ability could vary depending on the card it's on.

**Using Harvesting to Exile Cards:**

The Harvest mechanic could be linked to exiling cards in different ways. Here are some conceptual card examples:

2. **Cycle of Renewal** (Enchantment)
   - Whenever a creature you control dies, you may put a Seed Counter on Cycle of Renewal.
   - Harvest 5: Remove five Seed Counters from Cycle of Renewal: Exile target card from an opponent's graveyard. You gain life equal to its converted mana cost.
- ![](/static/Crop%20Elemental.png)
- Crop Elementals power and toughness equal to the amount of Seed tokens under your control
![](/static/Harvest%20Warden.png)
3. **Reaping Ritual** (Sorcery)
   - As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may remove any number of Seed Counters from permanents you control.
   - Exile up to X target cards from graveyards, where X is the number of Seed Counters removed this way.

4. **Grove Tender's Blessing** (Instant)
   - Put two Seed Counters on up to two target lands.
   - Harvest 2: Remove two Seed Counters from a land you control: Exile target artifact or enchantment.

5. **Harvest Warden** (Creature - Elemental)
   - Vigilance
   - When Harvest Warden enters the battlefield, put two Seed Counters on up to one other target permanent.
   - Harvest 4: Remove four Seed Counters from permanents you control: Exile target attacking or blocking creature until Harvest Warden leaves the battlefield.

imagine more harvest creatures that are combat focused deck

hite Nosaia deck:

1. **Harvestblade Champion** (Creature - Human Soldier)
   - Whenever you place a Seed Counter on another creature, Harvestblade Champion gets +1/+1 until end of turn.
   - Harvest 3: Harvestblade Champion gains trample and lifelink until end of turn.
   - Power/Toughness: 3/3

4. **Battalion Harvester** (Creature - Angel)
   - Flying
   - Whenever Battalion Harvester attacks, you may remove any number of Seed Counters from other lands you control. Battalion Harvester gets +1/+0 for each Seed Counter removed this way until end of turn.
   - Power/Toughness: 3/4

5. **Meadowguard Cook** (Creature - Kithkin Knight)
   - Vigilance
   - Harvest 3: Creatures you control get +2/+2 until end of turn.
   - Power/Toughness: 2/2
![](/static/Meadowguard%20Cook.png)
6. **Harvest Reaper** (Creature - Elemental)
   - Harvest Reaper's power and toughness are each equal to the number of Seed Counters among permanents you control.

**Verdant  Awakening** (Enchantment)

Mana Cost: {3}{G}{G}{W}{W}

Card Text:

Enchant unenchanted Land

- When Verdant Colossus's Awakening enters the battlefield, remove all Seed token from enchanted Land. Put that many +1/+1 counters on target Creature.
- Harvest 5: Target creature gains doublestrike until end of turn and fights up to one target creature you don't control.
- At the beginning of your upkeep, enchanted land has more then 10 seed tokens, you win the game 

Flavor Text:

"As the ancient energies of the land converge, a single seed grows into an unstoppable force of nature."

This enchantment would be a game-changer in any match, turning one of your creatures into a massive threat that can potentially win you the game outright if it becomes powerful enough. The Harvest mechanic adds an additional layer of strategy, allowing you to protect your colossal creature and clear the way by battling opponents' creatures.

Verdant Colossus's Awakening embodies the might of the land itself, making it an excellent finisher for a deck that builds up resources over time and seeks to dominate with impressive singular power rather than overwhelming numbers.

1x Windswept Heath (ktk)

what else could i add (i think i need more creatures)

Based on the theme of your White-Green Nosaia deck, which revolves around the Harvest mechanic and a focus on Seed Counters and combat, here are some creature suggestions that could synergize with your existing strategy:

1. **Knight of Autumn** - A versatile creature that can either destroy artifacts/enchantments, gain you life, or come in with additional counters – all of which are useful in various situations and can help with board presence.

2. **Tireless Tracker** - As you play lands, you'll get Clue tokens, which can be sacrificed to draw cards, and this creature gets larger with each Clue sacrificed. It fits the deck's land and counter themes while providing card draw.

3. **Conclave Mentor** - This creature makes any +1/+1 counters you would put on a creature more effective, which synergizes well with the Seed Counter theme if they interact with +1/+1 counters at all.

4. **Voice of Resurgence** - A strong two-drop that leaves behind a token if it dies during your opponent's turn, potentially getting very large if you play lots of creatures and spells during your own turn.

5. **Wilt-Leaf Liege** - A powerful lord for green and white creatures, giving them a significant stat boost and being a robust threat itself.

6. **Scavenging Ooze** - Great for graveyard interaction, gaining life, and growing in size; it's especially useful against decks that rely on graveyard strategies.

7. **Armada Wurm** - Generates a lot of power on the board by creating a 5/5 Wurm token with trample when it enters the battlefield.

8. **Sun Titan** - Can bring back lower-cost permanents from your graveyard to the battlefield whenever it enters the battlefield or attacks, offering recurring value.

9. **Sigarda, Host of Herons** - Provides a strong flying body that protects you from being forced to sacrifice creatures or other permanents.

10. **Stonecoil Serpent** - A flexible creature that can be cast for any amount of mana, comes with +1/+1 counters, and has several relevant abilities such as reach, trample, and protection from multicolored.

11. **Avacyn's Pilgrim / Llanowar Elves / Elvish Mystic** - One-mana dorks can help accelerate your game plan by providing additional mana early on.

12. **Thragtusk** - Offers life gain and leaves behind a token when it leaves the battlefield, providing resilience against removal.

13. **Adorned Pouncer** - Has double strike and can come back as a larger creature with eternalize, fitting the combat theme and providing late-game value.

14. **Lovestruck Beast** - Provides an early 1/1 creature token and a later 5/5 body that can be quite effective in combat.

15. **Rhonas the Indomitable** - Serves as an indestructible threat and can give other creatures you control trample and additional power.

When selecting creatures to add to your deck, consider how they will impact your overall strategy, including synergies with Seed Counters and the "Harvest" mechanic, as well as your deck's curve and mana base to ensure consistency in gameplay.

what could be other new keywords that would fit the theme besides harvest

Considering the themes and dynamics of Nosaia, with its emphasis on the dichotomy between the magic-reliant Rekar and the magic-averse Nos'iren, here are some keyword mechanic concepts that could fit into your setting:

1. **Cultivate (Nos'iren Theme):** You may place a cultivation counter on a land you control. Lands with cultivation counters have "{T}: Add one mana of any color." This reflects the Nos'ireni's deep understanding and nurturing of the land.

2. **Artisan (Nos'iren Theme):** When a creature with Artisan enters the battlefield or attacks, create a Colorless Artifact token named "Craftwork" with ", Sacrifice this artifact: Gain one life or add {C}." This represents the Nos'ireni's traditional craftsmanship and resourcefulness.

3. **Enlighten (Nos'iren Theme):** Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, Enlighten triggers an effect such as scrying, life gain, or untapping a permanent. This echoes the Nos'ireni pursuit of wisdom and enlightenment through non-magical means.

4. **Channel (Rekar Theme):** Tap an untapped artifact you control: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool. Use this mana only to cast spells with Channel. This ability would represent the Rekarians' capacity to harness their magical and technological creations for arcane power.

5. **Infuse (Rekar Theme):** As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may tap an untapped artifact you control. If you do, the spell gains an additional effect. Infuse showcases the Rekarians' ability to empower their magic through artifice.

6. **Forge (Rekar Theme):** Whenever a creature with Forge attacks, you may pay {2}. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that creature tapped and attacking. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step. This reflects the Rekarians' talent for magically duplicating their forces in battle.

7. **Meditate (Both Themes):** Put a meditation counter on this creature. Creatures with meditation counters cannot attack or block but have "{T}: Draw a card, then discard a card." It symbolizes the focus on inner peace and knowledge, fitting for monk-like characters or scholars from either region.

8. **Harmony (Nos'iren Theme):** If a creature with Harmony would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and tap it. It gains indestructible until end of turn. This would signify the Nos'ireni's dedication to balance and their ability to endure through tranquility.

9. **Concoct (Rekar Theme):** Sacrifice an artifact: Add mana of any color equal to the sacrificed artifact's mana cost. Use this mana only to cast creature spells or activate abilities of creatures. Concoct captures Rekar's inventive spirit in repurposing their creations for sudden bursts of energy.

10. **Ascend (Both Themes):** If you control ten or more permanents, you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game. Once you have it, creatures with Ascend gain additional abilities or power/toughness boosts. While not new to MTG, Ascend could easily be adapted to fit within Nosaia's lore, representing an individual's rise to prominence within their society.

Each of these mechanics can be further developed to reflect specific aspects of Nosaian culture and society, providing players with thematic and strategic depth as they build decks and play games within this rich fantasy setting.

These cards are designed to work within your deck's existing strategies while introducing new elements that can enhance the gameplay experience and interactions with the Harvest mechanic and Seed Counters.

The table is all the cards i decided to add come up with more cards to the table (in form of table).

My strategy is white using seeds for getting "attackier" (Not with 1/1 tokens) and green creating seeds. DONT PUT SEEDS ON CREAETURE

Here's a table with additional card ideas that align with your strategy of using White for combat-focused effects and Green for Seed Counter generation without placing Seed Counters on creatures:
