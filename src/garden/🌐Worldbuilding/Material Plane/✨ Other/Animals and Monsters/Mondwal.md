The Moon Whale lives in the waters throughout [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria). It lives in harmony with moon magic and the arcane energy that can be found everywhere in [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria). If necessary, it can even feed on the arcane energy. The Moon Whale symbolizes the magic around us and the creation of something new through magic. [Luniam](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Nether%20Plane/Gods/Luniam) created these creatures to strengthen moon magic.

The Moon Whale is a unique animal and is rarely encountered. It resembles a common blue whale, but can grow even larger. It has a special, unique pattern on its sides. This pattern glows in a pleasant blue or purple when the creature is filled with magical energy of any kind.
