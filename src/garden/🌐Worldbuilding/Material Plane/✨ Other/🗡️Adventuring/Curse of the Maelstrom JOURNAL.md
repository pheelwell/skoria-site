- Rinera, Winston and Cyrus begin to study on the academy of Evermore. They get sorted to their houses and get to know the academy. The get to know Gil, the Nerd.

- A magical journey is about to begin. 

## Chapter 2: The Explosive Lab Course and the Unknown Posession.
- Rinera, Winston and Cyrus starting 1 year later with their first mandatory practical laboratory course. Professor Zastrath is leading them through the course. 
	- They got a book with informations about various magical stones to make magical compounds for alchemy and other.
	- They should start making arcane powder.
	- When all the students look for their ingredients there is a conflict between Rinera and Trent which is fired by Cyrus. This caused Trent to escalate and use his fire magic. He destroys a table and most of Gil s notes. He is forced by Zastrath to go to the Principal. Zastrath leaves with him and Rinera, Winston and Cyrus are alone with Tuna in the class. They have the assignment to create arcane powder. 
	- Winston uses the moonlight extruder to grind some gems. Puts Skybreath into it and let it react with the Aurora Burner. Then with the Arcane Destillation he extracted the arcanol.
	- Cyrus tried something similiar, he used the Golem Fist to grind but he didnt used Skybreath. He used the Kenku Lance to heat it up and saw that Winston s Arcanol Idea was better. So he went with him
- Rinera, Winston and Cyrus made friends with Tuna 

1 year later  3rd year of School

- Rinera, Winston and Cyrus starting with their first mandatory Scryer Course . Professor Waespetor is leading them through the course. 
- They learn the essentials, but when Rinera should show them some Scrying with a magic ball she gets posessed by an unknown force, preaching a dark prophecy:
Erlischt das glühen am Tor des Lichtes, wird es fallen
Die Götter werden sich nehmen was ihnen gehört
Ihr Zorn wird auf ewig die Welt von [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Skoria) umkrallen
Das Ende aller Zeiten kommt, diese Welt wird zerstört
- Rinera should go to the Principal the next day.
- It was uncommon that Gil was not there, therefore he is never late for class.
	- they searched for Gil 
	- they found him in his Dorm, the lock was melted, a bird said that he saw a strange fiery light the night before
	- Gil was poisoned by the Trumpet Vine, maybe Trent has poisoned him.
	- Trent left the school, he was not seen again and it was impossible to get a good hint.
- The next day they went to Skripi (the principal) and got a mission.
- They need to create a Mythal and carry it to Rockwell, to master Anitor the Arcane and then to Lichtor
- They need to go as 3. They decided to take Tuna with them.
