Changelings are mysterious creatures with the ability to change their appearance, mimicking the form of other races. They are thought to be descended from a great and powerful race of shape-shifters, and thus have an affinity for magic. Changelings travel far and wide, never staying in one place for long, but always seeking knowledge to gain an edge over their enemies. They are often viewed with suspicion by other races, as they can blend in anywhere without detection. Despite this, Changelings remain a proud and noble people who strive to protect the innocent from harm.

## Biology

[Changeling](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Races/Changeling)¬†have red blood like a majority of the other races. Bleeding around others may alert many that the Changeling is not of the same race (should the blood color vary). For this reason, a Changeling will usually choose to take the form of a race with red blood. A close observer may notice that a Changeling's blood tends to run a bit thinner than most other races. Oddly enough, changelings have no bones. Instead, their skeletons are made entirely of cartilage (the same as some fish). Though not as tough as bone, it is a more flexible material. Some speculate that it is this limited flexibility that allows the bones of a changeling to change their size and shape.

## Well Known Facts

 Changeling culture is unique in many ways. They do not generally care about the concepts of law and order, but rather value freedom and self-expression above all else. Changelings are natural travelers and will often go from place to place seeking knowledge and adventure. They are loyal to their own kind, but they have no allegiance to any particular nation or people. They disdains the trappings of organized religion, preferring instead to rely on their own beliefs and intuition. Most changelings have a deep connection to nature, often taking on animalistic features such as fur or horns. They also have a deep respect for the arcane arts, using magic in their everyday lives. Though they are often viewed with distrust by other people, Changelings are thought of as wise and powerful by those who understand them best.
