The Toothless are a subgroup of Mercenary's working for the [Eyes of the Dragon](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Factions/Eyes%20of%20the%20Dragon). They consist of a 5 person crew.

**Leader:** Garox (Half Orc)

Garox is a fierce warrior, travelling the lands since he was old enough to walk. He has no qualms against killing in the name of gold and violence. A master of blades, Garox leads the Toothless with a iron fist and his loyalty to the [Eyes of the Dragon](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Factions/Eyes%20of%20the%20Dragon) is unwavering.

**Thief:** Malka (Human)

Malka is an opportunistic thief and smuggler who joined The Toothless after they saved him from a life of destitution and despair. He's not one for fighting, but his sharp wits have saved them on more than one occasion. He can often be found trying to find new ways to earn extra coin for their coffers.

**The Scout:**  Niran (Halfling)

Niran is a Halfling scout who joined The Toothless after hearing tales of their exploits across the lands. His small size allows him to move quickly and quietly through almost any terrain, giving the team an edge when scouting out new locations or gathering intel on potential targets.

**The Brawler:**  Dagur (Dwarf)

Dagur is a Dwarf who joined The Toothless with little more than his bare fists, but what he lacks in equipment he makes up for with sheer strength and determination. When all else fails, Dagur can be relied upon to throw himself into battle without fear or hesitation, often dealing out as much pain as he receives in return.

**Taken:** Kix ([Changeling](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Races/Changeling))

Kix is a [Changeling](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Races/Changeling) who has recently joined The Toothless.   Kix was taken in by Garox who saw the potential for them to use her shape-shifting abilities to infiltrate places that The Toothless might not otherwise be able to. Kix is still learning the ropes, but is proving to be a valuable asset to the team.

## Recent Activity

During the [Heist on the Castle Never](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%E2%9C%A8%20Other/Factions/Heist%20on%20the%20Castle%20Never) Kix left the Toothless with the stolen good, because when they were uncovered by a innocents bystanders the troop decided to coldheartedly kill all involved. This led to Kix question the Morals of the Troup.
