	- Four Arms: Naga have four arms, which give them superior dexterity and the ability to wield multiple weapons or perform complex tasks with ease. These arms are sinewy and strong, often adorned with intricate tattoos or jewelry.
2. Abilities:
	
	- Venomous Bite: Few Naga possess a venomous bite, the composition of which can vary between individuals. This venom is a potent weapon, often used to incapacitate or paralyze prey or foes.
   
3. Lifefestyle:
	
	- Isolated Enclaves: Naga society is often isolated from other species, hidden in remote and secretive enclaves. Their communities are well-guarded and shrouded in mystery.
	- Ambitious and Ruthless: Naga are known for their ambition and ruthless pursuit of their goals. They are skilled in politics, espionage, and dark magic.
	- They are originated from an underwater city in the Sea of Beasts

5. Relationships with Other Species:
	
	- Feared and Distrusted: Naga are generally feared and distrusted by other species. Their reputation for manipulation, treachery, and dark magic precedes them, making alliances rare.
	- Allegiances: Some Naga may form alliances with equally dark and malevolent species for mutual benefit, but these alliances are often temporary and fraught with danger.
6. Naming Conventions:
	
	- Naga names often reflect their sinister nature, with hissing sounds and dark, foreboding syllables. Their names may carry a sense of malevolence and power.
7. Lifespan:
	
	- Naga have a longer lifespan than many other humanoid species, typically living for 100 to 200 years. This extended lifespan allows them to amass knowledge and power over time.
