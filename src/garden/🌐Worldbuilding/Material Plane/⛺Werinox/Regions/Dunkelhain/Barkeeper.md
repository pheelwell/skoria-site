## Notes
- Skeptical, brusque; warns against night travel; offers rooms despite scarcity
- Trade route broken; shortages; fear of madness keeps him in place
- Interactions with party (keys, fire, drinks) reveal stress and resignation

## Hooks
- Supply chain quest; restoring trade to Dunkelhain
- Unravel his past: why stay in madness? family ties? lost promises?
