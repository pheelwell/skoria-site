# Yndrah — Undercity

Two-tier metropolis: an upper city above, and an underground Undercity carved into the mountain amid a toxic lake.

## Overview
- **Location**: Mountain on an island in a poisonous lake
- **Access**: Sealed boats cross toxic vapors to reach city
- **Nature**: Entire Undercity functions as a mine/biolab complex

## Notable Features
- **Ilarium** — Soft, organically-grown crystal mined continuously; potent alchemical substitute (e.g., Mindflayer brain reagents) used in potions for calm, control, analgesia, and narcotics
- **Green River** — Atmosphere-sustaining current powered by an artifact that must be regularly “fed” with magical objects
- **Life Support** — Artifact tied to [Lar](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Nether%20Plane/Gods/Lar) creates a breathable microclimate within toxic strata
- **Tech** — Necrotic magepunk; armored suits allow non-adapted workers to operate safely

## Society & Economy
- Worker strata below; dependency on Ilarium cultivation and artifact maintenance
- Research culture: scientists and mechanics study crystals, the river, and the habitat

## Threats & Rumors
- Undead bound to the artifact in the lower district; corruption tints the river green
- Upper and lower cities coexist in tension

## Campaign Seeds
> [!seed] Two-layer city — upper elite vs undercity workers in toxic conditions
> [!seed] The artifact binds undead; river corruption grows; artifact must be “fed” to prevent collapse
