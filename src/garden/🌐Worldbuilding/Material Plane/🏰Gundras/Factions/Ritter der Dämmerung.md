The Knights of Twilight are an association of smiths and knights. Among them are many followers of Fogweaver.

They have refined their skills and solidified their reputation as unwavering defenders of Erenos. They are known for their bravery, sense of duty, and loyalty to the land and its inhabitants.

Hierarchy and Structure

The Knights of Twilight are divided into two main groups: the smiths and the fighters. The smiths are responsible for gathering Miststeel and processing it into armor, weapons, and other items. The fighters are trained knights who use this equipment to protect Erenos from threats.

Within these groups there are various ranks:

- Mistforgers: The most experienced smiths with the best skills in handling Miststeel. There are only a few of these masters.
- Journeymen: Intermediate-level smiths who already have experience but have not yet reached the highest status.
- Apprentices: Young smiths who are just beginning to learn the art of blacksmithing.

- Knights of Twilight: The most experienced and talented fighters with leadership positions within the knights.
- Knights of Mist: Fully trained fighters who defend Erenos.
- Knights of Dew: Young fighters in training who serve a knight as an aide.

Rituals and Customs

The Knights of Twilight have some special customs and traditions:

1. Miststeel Forging: In this ritual, raw Miststeel is processed while invoking the god Luniam. It is meant to appease the deity so that they help the smiths to get the best out of the material and bless it with its power.
2. Oath of Allegiance: Every member of the Knights of Twilight takes an oath to protect and defend Erenos as well as to dedicate their life for the land and its inhabitants.

In Present Day

The Knights of Twilight continue to be a respected and important association in Erenos. They provide protection against threats, support local defense forces, and are known for their outstanding blacksmithing skills. Their influence has spread to neighboring countries, and sometimes the Knights of Twilight are asked for assistance when it comes to Miststeel or other blacksmith-related matters.

Despite their renown, they remain humble and devotedly loyal to their deity Fogweaver, who helps them master their skills and protects Erenos.
