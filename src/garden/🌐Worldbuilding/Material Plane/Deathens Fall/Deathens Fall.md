# Deathens Fall

A bleak expanse of ice-scoured ruins and bone-white horizons where travelers test spirit against the cold and silence.

## Overview
- **Climate**: Subarctic to polar; whiteouts; glass-ice plains
- **Hazards**: Necrotic squalls, crevasse mazes, frostbound dead
- **Sites**: Fallen keeps, frozen cathedrals, shard-choked fjords

## Pilgrimage
- **The Forsaken Path** — A Drinera-aligned rite through wastes; faith and resilience invite guidance

## Hooks
- Recover an ice-entombed reliquary before the next necrotic storm
- Escort pilgrims across the Forsaken Route as rival cults close in
