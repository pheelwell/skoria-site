This Giant River Flows through the entire Basin and is the main source of water. It flows very slowly and spans up to 20 miles at times. Water mainly comes from the Mountains in the north-west but also from smaller siderivers.

## Flow

This river flows through [[The Basin]] from north-west to south-east. It passes [[Trollbans Hold]] in the north-west flowing south-east it then divides near to [[Lichtachte]] flowing on both sides of the elevated highlands of [[Edschmied]].

At the hight of [[Duesternest]] in the south-east it comes back together flowing east for a bit. After that it flows down south where it leaves [[The Basin]] and north up to [[Herbstbog]]. 

## Importance

The river is of immense importance for the people in [[The Basin]]. It is a source of life and prosperity, providing them with water for crops, livestock, and drinking. It also serves as a natural border and protects them from unwanted intruders. The river is also the main source of transportation in this part of the world. Boats are used to transport people and goods along its length, while bridges allow easier access to different parts of [[The Basin]].

The slow-flowing river gives off a silent but strong presence that all must respect. Its mysterious depths draw adventurers from afar in search of forgotten treasures that may be hidden within its depths.

The banks of the river are beautiful to behold and some believe it to be enchanted by magical forces. It is said that if one takes a moment to stop and listen carefully, one can hear faint whispers coming from within the water, warning all who pass by about dangers or secrets hidden beneath the surface. 

Whether these tales are true or not remain unknown, but one thing is certain - this ancient river has been quietly watching over its inhabitants since long before any living memory can remember.
