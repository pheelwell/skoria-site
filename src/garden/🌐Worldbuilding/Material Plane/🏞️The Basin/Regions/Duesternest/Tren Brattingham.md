_"This is a crime scene! You can't just go around poking at things!"_ barks Tren Brattingham, his gaze narrowing as he scrutinizes every newcomer with a detective's practiced suspicion. Renowned for his tenacity and an unyielding commitment to uncovering the truth, Tren is the embodiment of diligence infused with a touch of paranoia.

>[!secret]
>Tren Brattingham harbors a deep-seated need for retribution for his brother's death—a driving force that oftentimes clouds his discernment.

In the city's underbelly where shadows whisper tales of intrigue and deceit, Tren is known as a man who delves into mysteries others dare not touch. His relentless search for answers leads him down dark alleys and into the heart of danger.

>[!info]
>A masterful investigator with an unfortunate blind spot—Tren can be too trusting for his own good, sometimes missing the duplicity hidden behind friendly facades.

His presence at any crime scene commands attention; he carries an air of authority that brooks no nonsense. When he isn't piecing together clues or interrogating reluctant witnesses, you can find him shuffling through his deck of cards—a habit that seems to ground him amidst chaos.

>[!tip]
>Introducing Tren as an NPC could offer PCs valuable insights or lead them astray based on how they navigate his complex personality and earn (or exploit) his trust.

With every case comes the risk that this one might echo his brother's fate—a specter that haunts Tren ceaselessly—but it only steels his resolve to fight against the darkness that took so much from him already.

>[!read]
>As players interact with Tren Brattingham at "The Burning Goose" tavern ruins, they'll uncover not just the mystery of fiery destruction but also cross paths with intrigues like those surrounding Reyala Althammer's murder—threads they can choose to unravel or ignore at their peril.
