The chilling wind whistles through the decaying streets of Melmorwich, a city of darkness and death that teems with unsettling activity. Undead creatures roam the alleys, mingling with humans who have either been turned into zombies or serve their undead masters.

## Overview

Melmorwich is a city founded many years ago by a necromancer who was killed in battle. The necromancer's resurrection went awry, causing the entire city to rise from the dead, driving out those who were still living. Today, Melmorwich is run by an undead society with a functioning government made up of powerful undead creatures and various Guildmasters leading their respective guilds.

Nestled atop a hill and surrounded by castle walls, Melmorwich's inner city is rundown and rancid - perfect for its undead inhabitants.
