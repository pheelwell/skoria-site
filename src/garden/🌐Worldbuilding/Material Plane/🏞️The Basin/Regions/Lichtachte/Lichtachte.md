### Cathedral of Light

#### Overview

The Cathedral of Light stands as the heart and soul of Lichtachte, a monumental structure dedicated to the god Arathor, the deity of light and righteousness. This grand edifice is not only a place of worship but also a fortress and a community center that provides sanctuary and hope to the citizens of Lichtachte. Surrounded by high fortified walls adorned with statues of Arathor, the cathedral exudes an aura of divine protection and grandeur.

#### Architecture & Layout

The cathedral's outer walls are a prime example, soaring high and lined with statues of Arathor in various heroic poses. These statues seem to watch over the city, providing both spiritual and physical protection.
  
- **The Grand Courtyard**: Upon entering through the main gates, visitors are greeted by a vast open courtyard filled with vibrant flowers and illuminated by the magical sunlight that bathes the city. This space serves as a gathering area for public ceremonies and festivity.

- **Main Sanctuary**: The centerpiece of the cathedral is its main sanctuary, an awe-inspiring hall filled with rows of pews leading up to an ornate altar dedicated to Arathor. Stained glass windows depict scenes from Arathor's legends, casting colorful light across the hall.

- **Catacombs**: Beneath the cathedral lies an extensive network of catacombs that serve as both a burial ground for honored dead and a stronghold against potential invaders. These catacombs also house secret chambers where artifacts are safeguarded.

- **Bell Tower**: The bell tower reaches towards the heavens, its tolls echoing throughout the city to announce important events or summon the faithful to prayer. The view from the top offers a breathtaking panorama of Lichtachte and its surrounding lands.

The reconstruction effort was monumental, involving many skilled artisans, architects, and laborers from across The Basin. The high fortified walls were added during this period, making it one of the most secure locations in Lichtachte.
