### Cathedral of Light

#### Overview

The Cathedral of Light stands as the heart and soul of Lichtachte, a monumental structure dedicated to the god Arathor, the deity of light and righteousness. This grand edifice is not only a place of worship but also a fortress and a community center that provides sanctuary and hope to the citizens of Lichtachte. Surrounded by high fortified walls adorned with statues of Arathor, the cathedral exudes an aura of divine protection and grandeur.

#### Architecture & Layout

- **The Outer Walls**: After a devastating attack by General Malachi's forces, Lichtachte was rebuilt with formidable defenses. The cathedral's outer walls are a prime example, soaring high and lined with statues of Arathor in various heroic poses. These statues seem to watch over the city, providing both spiritual and physical protection.
  
- **The Grand Courtyard**: Upon entering through the main gates, visitors are greeted by a vast open courtyard filled with vibrant flowers and illuminated by the magical sunlight that bathes the city. This space serves as a gathering area for public ceremonies and festivity.

- **Main Sanctuary**: The centerpiece of the cathedral is its main sanctuary, an awe-inspiring hall filled with rows of pews leading up to an ornate altar dedicated to Arathor. Stained glass windows depict scenes from Arathor's legends, casting colorful light across the hall.

- **Catacombs**: Beneath the cathedral lies an extensive network of catacombs that serve as both a burial ground for honored dead and a stronghold against potential invaders. These catacombs also house secret chambers where artifacts are safeguarded.

- **Bell Tower**: The bell tower reaches towards the heavens, its tolls echoing throughout the city to announce important events or summon the faithful to prayer. The view from the top offers a breathtaking panorama of Lichtachte and its surrounding lands.

#### Sections

2. **Shrine of Reflection**: A serene area for personal meditation and prayer, adorned with tranquil water features and soft lighting.

4. **Chapel of Healing**: A specialized chapel where clerics and paladins provide healing services using divine magic.
5. **Council Chambers**: The meeting place for members of the League of Arathor, where strategies are planned and important decisions made.

#### Politics & Influence

The Cathedral of Light is deeply intertwined with the politics of Lichtachte. High Paladin Erathenar holds court here, making crucial decisions that affect not just the city but also its allies in The Basin. The League of Arathor uses this sacred place as their headquarters, making it a hub for planning military campaigns against General Malachi's Defilers.

The cathedral also serves as a diplomatic center where emissaries from neighboring towns like Maerhof, Faern, and Prosnen come to seek aid or form alliances. The influence of the cathedral extends beyond religious matters; it plays a crucial role in the governance and defense of Lichtachte.

#### History

The original structure was built centuries ago but was severely damaged during a massive attack led by General Malachi's forces. The reconstruction effort was monumental, involving many skilled artisans, architects, and laborers from across The Basin. The high fortified walls were added during this period, making it one of the most secure locations in Lichtachte.

The cathedral has been blessed multiple times by high-ranking clerics and paladins, further imbuing it with divine protection. Over time, it has become a symbol not just of faith but also resilience, embodying Lichtachte's spirit against the encroaching darkness.
