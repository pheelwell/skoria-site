## Politics and Economy:

Falk maintains an alliance with the [[Defilers]], housing many undead among its population. Hidden deep within Basin's Forest, it holds no strategic importance in regional conflicts. This neutrality has allowed Falk to avoid wars or other major disputes in the area. The local economy relies heavily on logging and hunting, supplemented by trade from passing merchants.

## History:

Originally established as a small logging community, Falk attracted various settlers over time due to its abundant natural resources. Despite its remote location and lack of strategic importance, the town has remained neutral in wars or conflicts affecting the region. The town's relationship with the [[Defilers]] began when a group of undead sought refuge in Falk after being rejected by their former communities. The people of Falk offered them shelter, and these undead eventually became integrated into society.

## Culture and Religion:

Falk is a diverse town with a mix of humans, elves, and many undead residents. As such, there is no dominant religion or culture, but rather a blend of many different traditions and beliefs. In recent years, Falk has gained renown for its weekly competitions that attract travelers from far and wide. These events have brought an influx of trade and new ideas to Falk, further enriching its culture.

## Threats and Rumors:

While Falk is generally peaceful, there are dangers lurking in the surrounding forest. Wild animals such as bears and wolves pose a threat to those who venture too far from town. Additionally, bands of goblins have occasionally been sighted nearby, causing concern among local residents. The presence of the Defilers could potentially attract hostile forces or adventurers seeking to eradicate the undead.

## Campaign Connections:
- A mysterious artifact is discovered in the forest near Falk that seems to be connected to [[Gargula]]'s trinkets and omens. The party must investigate its origins and determine whether it poses a threat to the town or could be used for good.
- A group of adventurers arrives in Falk seeking help against an ancient evil they've unleashed while exploring nearby ruins. The party must join forces with them and prepare for battle against this powerful foe that threatens not only Falk but the entire region.

## Geography and Climate:

Falk is situated within Basin's Forest, surrounded by tall trees and abundant wildlife. Most of the houses are made of timber, with a few small farms scattered about. There is only one dirt road leading into Falk that winds its way through the forest. The climate is temperate, with mild summers and cold winters.
