## Appearance

**Human**

_"The shadows seem to cling to my very essence, as if she's made of darkness itself."_

Gargula is an enigmatic old woman with a hunched posture and unkempt gray hair. She is always seen wearing dark, tattered clothing that seems to blend in with the shadows. Her piercing eyes have an otherworldly feel to them, as if she sees more than mere mortals. When roleplaying Gargula, speak in a raspy voice and use cryptic language that hints at hidden knowledge.
