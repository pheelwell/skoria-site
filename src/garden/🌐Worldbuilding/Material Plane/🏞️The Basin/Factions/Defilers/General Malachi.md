Malachi is the leader of the [Defilers](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin/Factions/Defilers), and a powerful sorcerer. She was exiled from [Lichtachte](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin/Regions/Lichtachte) for her experiments with necromancy, but she has since amassed a great army of undead soldiers and orcs. She is a strong leader, and she defends her people with everything that she has. Her most controversial invention was called "The Plage" which she used to create many undead people after a big attack on [Lichtachte](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin/Regions/Lichtachte) by hordes of zombies.
