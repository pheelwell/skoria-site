The Defilers were formed in the wake of a great tragedy, when a powerful necromancer named [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] was exiled from her home in [[Lichtachte]]. Desperate and alone, [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] was determined to make a new life for herself, free from persecution. To that end, she traveled to [[The Basin]] and set up camp with her loyal followers, who had also been exiled from their homes.

In time, [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] gathered more followers - undead abominations created by her secret invention, The Plage. With her growing army of loyal soldiers and allies, [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] established the Defilers as a powerful force in [[The Basin]]. Though they were feared by many for their dark magic, they were devoted to protecting those whom they deemed innocent, and fought against anyone who sought to harm them.

Though it seemed at first that their goal was simply survival, it soon became clear that [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]]'s ambitions were far greater than that. She wanted to be accepted as living creatures in [[The Basin]] - not just tolerated as monsters or ignored and forgotten. As such, she strove to create an independent nation where everyone could live together peacefully - regardless of race or religion.

Under [[General Malachi]]’s leadership and [[Grushnak]]’s cunning tactics, the Defilers slowly gained recognition for their courage and ferocity in battle against greater odds. As more people began to see them as something more than monsters or tools of war, their cause was taken up by many brave souls who believed in their cause - even those among the [[League of Arathor]] who saw them as a potential ally against their common enemies. 

No matter what odds they faced or how much opposition they encountered along the way, the Defilers continued on their quest for acceptance from all corners of [[The Basin]] - proving time and again that they could be just as valiant and honorable as any other faction in its history. With each victory they forged new allies and strengthened old ones alike; together , they fought to create a world where everyone could live in peace and harmony, regardless of their past. 

Eventually, more and more people began to embrace the Defilers as part of their own nation, rather than an enemy to be vanquished. Many former members of the [[League of Arathor]] joined their ranks, embracing their cause and fighting alongside them for what they believed in. With their combined forces, the Defilers launched several successful campaigns against the forces of darkness that plagued [[The Basin]].

Even those in [[Lichtachte]], who had once exiled [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] for her necromancy, eventually acknowledged her leadership and strength - if not her methods - and welcomed the Defilers into their cities as honorable allies. In time, [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]]’s vision became a reality: The Defilers were no longer viewed as monsters or enemy forces but as valuable members of society whom brought peace to [[The Basin]].  

## Organization Structure

The Defilers have an organized and disciplined structure, with [[General Malachi]] as their leader and [[Grushnak]], the orc chieftain, as her second-in-command. All of their members are expected to be loyal and follow orders without question. 

Their forces are divided into two main groups: The Undead Legion and the Orcen Horde. The Undead Legion is led by [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]] herself, who commands them from atop a white skeletal steed. Her loyal lieutenants are powerful undead sorcerers who follow her command without hesitation. The Orcen Horde, meanwhile, is lead by [[Grushnak]] and his warriors from the nearby mountains.

Below them are the small units of infantry and archers that make up the bulk of the Defilers' forces. These troops obey their commanders without question, but some of them have their own ideas about how to conduct themselves in battle. They can be fiercely independent at times, which can cause some problems for [[General Malachi.md|Malachi]]'s plans.

Finally, there is a large group of necromancers who use their magic to create more undead warriors for the Defilers' army. These necromancers have no real rank or position; they simply act on orders from [[General Malachi]] or [[Grushnak]] when needed. 

The Defilers may not be a unified group in terms of ideology or loyalty, but they are unified in their goal: to become an accepted force in [[The Basin]] and take control of it for themselves. Their organization has allowed them to gain power and strength over time, making them a formidable force to be reckoned with. - [[Defilers.md| ]]
