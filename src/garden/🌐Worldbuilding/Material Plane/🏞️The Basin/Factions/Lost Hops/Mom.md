## Backstory

Mom had always been a talented and inventive individual. Growing up in a small village, her love of tinkering with tools and inventing machines quickly became well known. Her talents caught the attention of local individuals who coerced her into helping them smuggle contraband into the city. Despite her initial reluctance, Mom soon proved to be an invaluable asset, gaining a reputation as an inventive genius.

Word of her skills eventually reached a mysterious underground organization known as The Lost Hops. Seeing potential in her abilities, they offered her a place among them. Recognizing an opportunity to help others, Mom accepted and became one of their leading members.

Initially focused on mastering subterfuge and stealth required for smuggling operations, Mom soon realized that members of The Lost Hops needed more than just stealth—they needed protection from those who wished them harm. To address this, she invented the Ritual of Name, a process allowing members to erase memories of their past identities. This ensured that no one outside The Lost Hops could harm or threaten them.

The Ritual of Name became integral to Lost Hops operations, allowing them to carry out their activities with impunity and providing an added layer of protection that even their enemies found hard to penetrate. Thanks to Mom's ingenuity, members of The Lost Hops can now operate under cover in relative safety while still providing much-needed goods and services to those unable or unwilling to purchase from traditional supply chains.
