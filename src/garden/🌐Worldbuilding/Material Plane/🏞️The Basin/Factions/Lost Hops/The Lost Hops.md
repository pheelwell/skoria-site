Their goal is to steal from the rich and wealthy and provide contraband to the poor and needy.

The smuggling operation is led by a woman named [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena), who is an expert in stealth and subterfuge.

[Duesternest](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CRegions%5CDuesternest/Duesternest) is the base of Operations for the Theives, they stand in good faith with the city guard and have a hidden laboratory and brewing area under the city.

The current Lord is aware of the stealing of the Lost Hops, but is ok, since he is not about wealth, but the happiness of people.

The Lost Hops have a hidden laboratory and brewing area under the city. They use this area to brew their beer, and to alter the stolen magic items to new products that they can sell. They also use this area to store stolen goods, and to plan their next heists. When traveling, they use their brewing carts that sell beer.

All leaders of he Lost Hops have their names erased from memory by magical means. Only the publicly known figures have a fake name that the public Recognizes.

## Structure of the Lost Hops

The Lost Hops are organized into two groups, each led by a captain, called "[Mom](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Mom)" and "[Dad](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Dad)". The "Parents" report to [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena), and she gives them their orders.

The group is relatively small, with only around 40 members.

## Founding of the Lost Hops

 The story of the Lost Hops began with the enigmatic [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena). She was a Changeling Rogue and skilled brewer, who had lived a life of subterfuge and stealth. By chance, she stumbled upon [Duesternest](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CRegions%5CDuesternest/Duesternest), an abandoned city in the heart of a deep forest, otherwise known as the Wilds. She took up residence in an old brewery and used it as a base of operations for her new smuggling operation.

[Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena) quickly gained followers who were drawn to her kind and caring demeanor, but also her fierce determination to steal from the rich and provide contraband to the poor. Soon enough, she had organized herself into a large group called the Lost Hops.

One of her first recruits was Uncle, a Artificer notorious for selling magical items and counterfeits. [Dad](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Dad) followed soon after Uncle’s arrival. He was an Air Genasi Rogue with an extensive knowledge of lockpicking; specifically, he led his own squad of burglars called their “Sons” who specialized in breaking into homes and shops undetected. All members were named after birds such as Finch, Raven, and Crow in order to better disguise their identities from outsiders.

[Mom](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Mom) arrived last as the head of logistics. She was a fire genasi artificer with a knack for making magical items and inventions. She quickly formed her own squad of pickpockets and purse snatchers referred to as the “Daughters”, all of which were named after flowers. As a security procedure she invented the Ritual of Name.

The Lost Hops flourished under [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena)’s leadership and [Duesternest](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CRegions%5CDuesternest/Duesternest) became their base of operations. Despite their illegal activities, the city guard viewed them as allies due to their good faith efforts, allowing them to continue with their operations in secrecy. With each new recruit, [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena) would conduct a Ritual of Name, erasing memories of past identities from all members in order to ensure total loyalty to the group. 

To this day, the Lost Hops still flourish under [Helena](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin%5CFactions%5CLost%20Hops/Helena)’s leadership and are ever-vigilant in protecting the downtrodden with their secret smuggling operations.

The Lost strongly despise the The Triad because of their Greed and Political influence
