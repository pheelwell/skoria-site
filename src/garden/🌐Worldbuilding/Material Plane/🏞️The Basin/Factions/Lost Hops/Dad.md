_"I'm not a thief, I'm a burglar. There's a difference."_

Dad is the charismatic and cunning captain of [The Lost Hops](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Material%20Plane/%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin/Factions/Lost%20Hops/The%20Lost%20Hops) break-in crew. As an Air Genasi Rogue, he is exceptionally skilled in the art of lockpicking and stealth. With an agile physique and quick-thinking mind, he finds exhilaration in the thrill of the heist and the satisfaction of a clean getaway. Dad commands two crews of burglars known as the Sons and Daughters, each member taking on bird-themed code names like Finch, Raven, and Crow to maintain their anonymity.
