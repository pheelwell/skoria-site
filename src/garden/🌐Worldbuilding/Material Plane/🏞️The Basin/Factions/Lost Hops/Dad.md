_"I'm not a thief, I'm a burglar. There's a difference."_


Dad is the charismatic and cunning captain of [[The Lost Hops]] break-in crew. As an Air Genasi Rogue, he is exceptionally skilled in the art of lockpicking and stealth. With an agile physique and quick-thinking mind, he finds exhilaration in the thrill of the heist and the satisfaction of a clean getaway. Dad commands two crews of burglars known as the Sons and Daughters, each member taking on bird-themed code names like Finch, Raven, and Crow to maintain their anonymity.
