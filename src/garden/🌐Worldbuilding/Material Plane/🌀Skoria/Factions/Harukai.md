## General Information

The Harukai are an ancient cult, shrouded in mystery and revered for their deep connection to the world of Skoria. As eternal wanderers, they traverse this land in pairs, embodying the timeless bond between master and scholar. Their journeys are a testament to their belief in balance, navigating the delicate interplay between Sori, the embodiment of the sun, and Luniam, the essence of the moon. Among their ranks, some devoutly worship Mysteria, the enigmatic deity who weaves the imagination and power in Skoria.

## Culture

The Harukai culture is one of profound respect for nature and the cosmos. They see themselves as part of a larger tapestry, living in harmony with the world around them. While they honor nature and its bounties, they also recognize the necessity of taking what they need to survive, always striving to maintain equilibrium. This balance is not just a philosophical ideal but a way of life, guiding their actions and decisions. They are still Warriors and are open to those people who need help.

Central to their culture is the Codex of Honour, a comprehensive set of guidelines that dictate their conduct. This codex emphasizes virtues such as integrity, humility, and respect for life, ensuring that every Harukai acts in a manner befitting their esteemed order. The Codex of the Harukai is considered sacred, and adherence to its principles is seen as both a duty and a privilege.

## Society

The Harukai society is structured around the relationship between the master and the scholar. This pair is the core of their community, with each pair functioning as an independent unit yet remaining interconnected with the larger Harukai network. The master imparts wisdom and knowledge to the scholar, who in turn, learns and grows until they are ready to take on a scholar of their own. This cycle ensures the preservation and transmission of their ancient traditions and skills.

Harukai members are easily recognizable by their traditional armour and holy weapons, which they carry at all times. These items are not only practical tools but also symbols of their identity and commitment. The armour is crafted with intricate designs that tell the story of the Harukai's history and their individual journeys, while the holy weapon is a manifestation of their spiritual and martial prowess.

## Conclusion

The Harukai stand as timeless sentinels of balance in the world of Skoria, their lives a delicate dance between the forces of light and darkness. Their unwavering commitment to the Codex of Honour and their harmonious relationship with nature set them apart as both warriors and philosophers. Through the perpetual cycle of master and scholar, they ensure that their ancient traditions endure, weaving their presence into the very fabric of Skoria. The Harukai are more than just an ancient cult; they are the living embodiment of balance, guardians of a timeless wisdom that transcends the ages.
