Nestled in the heart of the vast and unforgiving [Irasnian Wastes](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes/Irasnian%20Wastes) lies the city of Quorritset, an oasis of life and activity amidst the endless dunes. The city is primarily inhabited by two races: the small, reptilian [Quorri](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CFactions/Quorri), for which the city is named, and the [Solith](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CFactions/Solith), a hardy people who have adapted to life in the desert.

## Geography

Quorritset is built around a series of natural springs that provide a constant supply of water to its inhabitants. This precious resource has allowed for the growth of lush vegetation within the city's walls, creating a stark contrast to the barren landscape that surrounds it.

The city itself is divided into several districts, each with its own distinct character:

- The Oasis District: Located in the heart of Quorritset, this district is home to the largest concentration of springs and greenery. It serves as a central gathering place for residents and visitors alike.

- The Market District: As a vital hub for trade between various settlements across the [Irasnian Wastes](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes/Irasnian%20Wastes), this bustling district offers a wide array of goods from both local craftsmen and foreign merchants.

- The Residential District: This area houses most of Quorritset's permanent residents within its winding streets and tight-knit neighborhoods.

- The Outer Walls: Forming a protective barrier against both sandstorms and potential invaders, these towering fortifications are manned by skilled guards who keep watch over all who approach Quorritset's gates.
