## Scenery and Climate:

The Isranian Wastes stretch below [The Basin](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9E%EF%B8%8FThe%20Basin/The%20Basin), a seemingly endless expanse of sand dunes broken only by jagged rock formations. In the eastern regions of this desolate landscape lies [Zarinesh's Hand](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CRegions/Zarinesh%27s%20Hand) - an enormous stone hand that serves as both a geographical wonder and a divine symbol. The [Lifeblood River](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes/Lifeblood%20River) flows from this colossal monument towards the Cold Sea in the south, providing much-needed water for those who dwell nearby.

Central regions of Isranian Wastes are dominated by The Salt Flats - vast areas of cracked earth covered in salt deposits. These lands are rumored to be cursed and haunted by restless spirits which only adds to their eerie atmosphere.

The climate is one of extremes: scorching days give way to freezing nights where temperatures can plummet drastically within hours. Sandstorms are a common occurrence making navigation difficult even for those well-acquainted with this hostile terrain.

## Flora and Fauna:

Despite its desolate appearance, the Isranian Wastes are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. Along the [Lifeblood River](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes/Lifeblood%20River), hardy vegetation thrives, fed by the precious water that flows from [Zarinesh's Hand](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CRegions/Zarinesh%27s%20Hand). The delta where the river meets the Cold Sea is lush and green, a stark contrast to the barren wasteland that surrounds it.
