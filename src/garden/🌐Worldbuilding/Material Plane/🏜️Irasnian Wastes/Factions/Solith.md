Hailing from the unforgiving landscape of 🌐Skoria/🌐Worldbuilding/Material Plane/🏜️Irasnian Wastes/Irasnian Wastes, the native insectoid species, the Solith, have evolved to thrive in their harsh desert homeland. They have built a unique society within the city walls of [Quorritset](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CRegions/Quorritset), overcoming significant cultural discrepancies and occasional discord to share their habitat with another race – the reptilian [Quorri](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CMaterial%20Plane%5C%F0%9F%8F%9C%EF%B8%8FIrasnian%20Wastes%5CFactions/Quorri).
