## The Aftermath of [The Shattering](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/The%20Shattering)

[The Shattering](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/The%20Shattering) was a cataclysmic event that resulted from a dispute between two groups of gods. The conflict caused devastation on a massive scale, wiping out 85% of Skoria's population and resetting the entire civilization. Many species were forever lost as a result of this apocalyptic event.

In the wake of [The Shattering](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/The%20Shattering), the god [Arathor](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Arathor) built a barrier between Skoria and the [Nether Plane](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane/Nether%20Plane) with the help of [Lar](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding%5CNether%20Plane%5CGods/Lar). They used the remains of Umbrial to create this barrier, preventing any further direct interference from divine beings in Skoria.

With divine forces finding ways to infiltrate Skoria once again, the world began experiencing an increase in otherworldly encounters. As gods sought to influence mortals through various means, societies adapted and evolved in response to these divine interventions.
