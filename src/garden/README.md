## [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore

Welcome to the [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore repository!

This repository contains a collection of Markdown files that hold the common lore, history, and knowledge about our roleplay world - [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria). Our goal is to create a synchronized and unified source of truth for all players and game masters involved in our adventures.

By using this repository, you can easily integrate the latest lore updates into your own Obsidian vaults and keep track of any changes made by others. If you're new to using Git or Obsidian, don't worry! This README will guide you through the process step-by-step.

### Getting Started

To integrate this repository into your own Obsidian vault, you'll need to use a Git client. We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) because it's beginner-friendly and works well with both Windows and macOS.

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer.
2. Create a free GitHub account if you don't already have one.
3. Send a message to **pheelwell** on Discord or any other platform where we're connected, requesting to be added as a collaborator to this repository. Once you've been granted access, proceed with the following steps.

6. Select the `URL` tab and copy-paste the following link: `https://github.com/pheelwell/skoria.git`
7. Choose a local path where you want the files to be stored on your computer. This should be inside your vault.
8. Click on `Clone`. The repository will now be cloned into your chosen folder.

### Updating Your Vault

Whenever there are new updates or changes made to the [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore by other collaborators, you'll need to update your own Obsidian vault to stay in sync with the latest information.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. In the list of repositories, select `skoria`.
3. Click on Fetch `origin` or `Pull` at the top right corner of GitHub Desktop.
4. If there are any new changes, they will be automatically downloaded and merged with your local files.

And that's it! Your Obsidian vault should now display the latest updates from the [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore repository.

If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to *pheelwell* or any other members of our community. Happy roleplaying!

### Add Own Changes

Just write Articles according to the [Note Structure Guidelines](/garden/Meta/Note%20Structure%20Guidelines).

The `Main` branch is protected, so you won't be able to add to it. To add your own changes to the [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore repository, you'll need to create a new branch and submit a pull request. Here's how to do it:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. In the list of repositories, select `skoria`.
3. At the top of GitHub Desktop, click on the `Current Branch` dropdown menu.
4. Click on `New Branch` and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "new-location-lore").
5. Make sure the new branch is based on the `main` branch.
6. Click on Create Branch`.

Now you can make changes to the Markdown files in your local folder using Obsidian or any other text editor.

Once you've made your changes:

7. Go back to GitHub Desktop.
8. In the left panel, review your changes and make sure everything looks as intended.
9. At the bottom left corner, enter a brief summary of your changes in the "Summary" field (e.g., "Added lore for New Location").
10. Optionally, add more details in the "Description" field if needed.
11. Click on Commit to `[your-branch-name]`.

Now that you've committed your changes locally, it's time to submit a pull request:

12. At the top right corner of GitHub Desktop, click on `Publish Branch` if this is your first time pushing this branch online.
13. Once published (or if you've pushed before), click on `Create Pull Request`. This will open a new page in your web browser.
14. On this page, review your changes and provide any additional information if needed.
15. Click on Create `Pull Request`.

Your pull request will now be submitted for review by other collaborators who can either approve or request further changes before merging it with the main branch.

Please be patient while waiting for feedback and be prepared to make additional adjustments if requested. Once your pull request is approved and merged, your changes will become part of the [Skoria](/garden/%F0%9F%8C%90Worldbuilding/Skoria) World Lore repository, and everyone else can sync their Obsidian vaults to see your contributions!
