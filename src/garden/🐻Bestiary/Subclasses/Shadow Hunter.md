You can choose the **Shadow Hunter** subclass for the **Rogue** class. 

Shadow hunters are masters of voodoo and shadow magic and were once the highest authority amongst trolls. Their spirit powers is walking the line of dark and light in hope of saving the future of trollkind, doing whatever it takes to secure a future for their kin. The loa can channel themselves through the shadow hunters when they use their ceremonial rush'kah masks.

The Shaddow Hunters worship one of the major Loas. They do this by making Deals with them and following their ideals. The relationship between a Shaddow Hunter and his Loa differs from a Acolyte and his God. Loas are more seen as mentors and elders, it is not uncommon that Shaddow Hunters bicker and argue with their Loas. This leeds to Shaddow Hunters often temporarily falling out of Faith of the Loas. This can be made good with offerengs and deeds devoted to the Loa.
