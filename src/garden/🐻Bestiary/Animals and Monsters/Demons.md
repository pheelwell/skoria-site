Living in the void between the nether and the other planes. 

They are the product of the shattering. So many creatures, mana and magic was devoured in the void between the planes that some complete new species originated form there. They are chaotic evil and follow no god. They follow no rules, the live by their instinct and try to reach a plane of existence where they can find something to satisfy their instincts.
