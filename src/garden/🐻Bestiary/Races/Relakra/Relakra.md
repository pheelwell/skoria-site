## Introduction

Relakra is a humanoid, nomadic race distinguishable by their unique ability to sense and feed on the emotions of other races and the glowing orb in place of their heart. This orb changes form based on the emotions they feed on, visual indicators of their emotional state. They do not cause any harm or loss of emotion to others, but they cannot thrive on their own kind's emotions, leading them to lead solitary lives or integrate into other societies. 

Relakras age rapidly but feeding on emotions can prolong their lifespan, with most Relakras living up to 30 years if they consistently nourish on emotions.

## Physical Description

Relakra are similar in appearance to humans but possess vibrant eye colors that seem to shimmer with an inner glow â€“ a hallmark of their emotion-feeding trait. They typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, with bodies that are light yet sturdy, weighing anywhere between 110 to 230 pounds. Their skin tones range from pale white to dark brown and even hues of blues and greens in rare cases.

In place of where a heart would normally be located, there is a luminescent orb within a hole in their chest - a physical manifestation of the emotions they've absorbed over time. These orbs can change shape and color based on what feelings the Relakra feeds off - for instance, an intense red flame for anger or calming blue waves for tranquility.

## Society

Given their nomadic lifestyle, Relakras do not have a typical societal structure. They often live alone or in small groups, moving from place to place in search of emotions to feed on. However, some choose to settle down and integrate into societies of other races.

Over time, depending on which emotion they frequently feed upon - be it joy, sorrow or anger - they evolve into various subraces which further influence their behavior and inclinations.

## Subraces

There are several subraces of Relakra determined by their most frequently absorbed emotion:

**Joyous Ones**: These Relakra primarily feed off joy and happiness they evoke in others. Their orbs emit warm golden light akin to sunshine.

**Passionate Ones**: These prefer intense emotions like love or anger causing their orbs to blaze with vibrant reds.

**Adventurous Ones**: Those who opt for thrill and excitement have orbs that flicker with energetic orange hues.

**Desolate Ones**: These Relakra feed off feelings of despair and sorrow reflecting in orbs that shimmer eerily with sickly teal light.

**Envious Ones**: These Relakra are pulled towards feelings of jealousy and envy, generating orbs that glow with a vivid green light.

**Ful Ones**: These Relakra are drawn to feelings of tranquility and satisfaction. Their orbs radiate a calm, soothing blue light.

**Surprised Ones**: They feed off sudden shocks or surprises. Their orbs flash with a bright yellow light. 

**Curious Ones**: These Relakra thrive off the excitement and anticipation of curiosity and discovery. Their orbs shimmer with a lively shade of purple.

**Fearful Ones**: These Relakra feed off fear and terror, leading their orbs to emit an unsettling glow of icy blue or ghostly white.

The choice of emotional preference occurs organically over time as the Relakra 'tastes' different feelings thereby influencing its yearning for specific types.

## Lore and History

Relakras are believed to have originated from an ancient lineage of elf-like beings that had a deep connection with the emotional realm. This connection evolved over time into their present form - humanoid beings capable of sensing and feeding off other creatures' emotions while bearing an emotion-infused orb within them.

Due to this unique feeding habit wherein each absorbed emotion could potentially alter the course of their lives by changing their subrace affinity, each individual's life journey is filled with richly diverse experiences creating vivid tales full of emotional dynamism - stories relished by other races creating unique bonds between the otherwise solitary Relakras and those around them.
