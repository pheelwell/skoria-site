Skrixis are a race of insectoid humanoids who resemble humanoid grasshoppers, with sleek, segmented exoskeletons that range in color from earthy greens and browns to iridescent blues and golds. Their long, flexible antennae twitch with sensitivity to vibrations, allowing them to detect movement and sound with uncanny precision. Their powerful hind legs enable them to leap great distances, and their chitinous carapace provides natural armor.

## Skrixis Traits

Skrixis are agile, resilient insectoids with powerful leaps, chitinous armor, and keen vibrational senses.

### Molting Regeneration

As an action, you shed your exoskeleton to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier. For the next minute, your AC decreases by 2 until you complete a short rest.

### Powerful Legs

Your jump distance is doubled. As a bonus action, you can leap up to 20 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically without provoking opportunity attacks. Usable a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, recharging at dawn. 

### Antennae Awareness

You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on vibration detection.

### Protein Popcorn

You have vulnerability to fire damage. Your exoskeleton cracks loudly when exposed to extreme heat, giving you disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in fiery environments. 

### Ability Score Increase

Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

### Chitinous Carapace

Your exoskeleton grants natural armor. While unarmored, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
